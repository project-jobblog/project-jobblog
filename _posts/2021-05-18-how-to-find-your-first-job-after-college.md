Yey! You&#8217;ve completed your studies and are now looking for your first job after college. Despite this, you have a lot of questions. You&#8217;re probably wondering what your choices are, where to begin your job search, how to negotiate a salary, and even how long you should consider staying in your first job.

Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions about landing the first entry-level job.

Here are some answers to some of the most common concerns new graduates have about finding their first job after college.

### **Does My First Job Out of College Have to Match My Major?**

The short answer is no, you do not have to find a job that matches your major. In today&#8217;s job market, a college degree may be a qualification for many jobs, but a specific major is not frequently required for most roles.

Employers are more interested in seeing transferable skills on your resume that relate to the job to which you&#8217;re applying. These skills can be obtained from a variety of past experiences such as:

  * internships
  * part-time job
  * student organizations
  * class projects
  * volunteer work

If you have specific skills or certifications, you should feature them on your resume.

In the requirements or qualifications section of the job description, job opportunities that require a degree in a particular major will state so. This is more common in specialist fields like health care jobs, where a medical doctor or nurse is required to have a medical degree or license.

### **How Can I Show My Experience If I Haven&#8217;t Had a Job Like This?**

It&#8217;s fine if you&#8217;ve never worked in a role similar to the one you&#8217;re applying for! Employers recognize that this is your first work out of college and that you are still early in your career. An employer is trying to figure out what kinds of interactions you&#8217;ve had that fit the skills and competencies required for the job.

Consider emphasizing your academic accomplishments, such as related coursework, class projects, and participation in student organizations. You may also suggest starting your own side project, freelancing, contracting, or volunteering to gain the skills you need for the position you want.

### **How Do I Identify the Most Appropriate Positions to Apply For?**

  * Completing a self-assessment

To ensure that the company&#8217;s values, mission, industry, size, compensation, and benefits are consistent with your professional needs, research the company&#8217;s values, mission, industry, size, compensation, and benefits.

### **How Long Can I Work at an Entry-Level Position?**

After college, entry-level jobs are a perfect way to learn the skills and training you didn&#8217;t get in school. Since entry-level hires also have a longer training time, you should expect to work for at least two years and leave no sooner than one year.

Employers are aware of the time and energy required for training and onboarding a good new recruit, and your next employer will devote resources to helping you learn and improve the skills you&#8217;ll need to advance professionally and make an impact. If you&#8217;re thinking about jumping ship, you should think about the investment.

In addition, if an employee hasn&#8217;t been in their current position for one or two years, another employer may be reluctant to interview them for a job opening. While job-hopping isn&#8217;t as much of a red flag as it once was, an employer can expect that a job-hopper would leave for the next hot offer before they&#8217;ve completed their training.

A applicant who shows dedication has a better chance of being chosen for an interview.

Furthermore, entry-level careers are about more than just learning new skills. At work, you&#8217;ll also make some valuable connections and expand your professional network. Too much hopping will jeopardize those relationships and keep you from making a lasting impact on people who may be able to assist you later in your career. Take the time to cultivate these connections and learn from your coworkers. It will help you in your job quest in the future.

### **Here&#8217;s where you can find your first job after college**

We understand that you have a lot of concerns about how to find work as a recent graduate. Fortunately, You&#8217;ll have access to job search tools and career opportunities, which will relieve some of the stress.
