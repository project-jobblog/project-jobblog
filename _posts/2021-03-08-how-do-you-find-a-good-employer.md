Trust. A basic five-letter word with the ability to make or break any relationship. And we&#8217;re not only talking about personal relationships here; trust and a good employer is also important in the workplace.

According to the [survey](https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2020-01/2020%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Global%20Report.pdf), 76 percent of workers trust their employers. You want to be a part of that 76 percent as a job seeker, but how do you do it? It&#8217;s difficult to tell whether you can trust an organization before you start working for them.

Here are methods you can use during your job search to determine whether or not each potential employer is trustworthy:

### **During an interview, ask the right questions**

The interview isn&#8217;t just about demonstrating that [you&#8217;re a good match for the company](/how-to-figure-out-if-you-are-right-for-the-job/); it&#8217;s also about demonstrating that they&#8217;re a good fit for you. Use the time you have together to emphasize the importance of employee-employer trust in the decision-making process.

Ask straightforward questions that draw on what matters most to you. For example, if you want to know if you can trust an employer&#8217;s commitment to provide professional growth and advancement opportunities, ask for clear examples of how they&#8217;ve done it before. Then go a step further and inquire about how they plan to provide you with the same (should you receive an offer).

### **Look at the company&#8217;s social effects**

Every potential employer is competing for top talent, which means they&#8217;ll go to great lengths to make the company appear appealing. Many are doing so by enhancing their employer brand and emphasizing a common goal shared by all candidates: make the world a better place.

If you look at the company&#8217;s social media feeds or website, you could come across stories about how they&#8217;ve helped the local community or posts about volunteer opportunities for employees. It&#8217;s important to remember, though, that they&#8217;re making the story they want you to see. What is the real societal effect of their actions?

The ability of social media to manipulate reality is astounding. So go to Google and do some research on your own: To find out if the prospective employer portrays achievements in a truthful and trustworthy way, look up the company&#8217;s title, leaders&#8217; titles, and so on.

### **Examine the feedback on the job site**

Be wary of company job sites, particularly if you believe that companies want to appear as appealing as possible. Each one is intended to entice you in and make you feel a sense of belonging. A potential employer will highlight the best qualities, such as:

  * Adaptability/Flexibiltyy
  * Work-life balance is important.
  * Unrestricted PTO (Personal Time Off)
  * Competitive Salary
  * Amazing Benefoits

But, before you get too excited about the prospect of [landing your dream job](/how-to-find-your-dream-job/), do some research. When you compare those feedback to the promises made by the job site, you will determine whether or not the statements made by employers are true.

### **Talk to existing staff**

Even if it can feel uncomfortable at first to initiate discussions with current workers, the payoff is well worth it. Speaking with them is the most effective way to determine if a company&#8217;s branding/messages are accurate and reliable. You&#8217;ll also be able to see if their interview commitments are consistent with their daily acts.

For instance, you might expect your future employer to offer updated training to any workers who are impacted by automation or innovation (both of which are hot topics in today&#8217;s job market). However, according to the survey, only 30% of workers believe their company would do so — information that will most likely surface in discussions with current employees.

Don&#8217;t limit your networking to your upcoming boss or hiring manager. Make contact with future coworkers. Those in the trenches would be able to report on whether or not leaders follow through on employee reviews, honor their mandate, keep promises, and so on.

It may sound cliched, but trust is a two-way street. Be open and honest about what you have to give, and your potential employer will most likely do the same.
