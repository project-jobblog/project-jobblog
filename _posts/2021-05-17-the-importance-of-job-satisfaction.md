While it&#8217;s easy to become fixated on a job that matches your major, the necessary credentials, and the pay, there are many other considerations to consider when looking for work. Overall work satisfaction is an important consideration.

According to a study [published](https://www.statista.com/statistics/717104/greatest-contributors-to-employee-satisfaction/) in 2019, the commute and coworkers had the biggest effect on an employee&#8217;s job satisfaction.

COVID-19 has had a major impact on the workplace since then. Though company culture continues to play a significant role in long-term satisfaction, it is now calculated in a different way. The workplace with the best breakfast bar for socializing with coworkers, for example, is no longer a good indicator of which job can provide the most satisfaction.

## **How do we prioritize the value of job satisfaction?**

### **Working Conditions and Environment**

This may sound insignificant, but the work environment has a significant effect on your job satisfaction. Your success, mood, concentration, and satisfaction are all influenced by the world in which you work.

As a consequence, it&#8217;s critical to figure out what kind of atmosphere would suit you best. Do you want a private office or an open floor plan? Is it necessary for it to be well-lit or dimly lit? If you have any aesthetic preferences? These are some of the considerations to make when assessing a prospective employer.

Find a company that has the best workspace that will ultimately suit your working preferences and make you feel like the most productive and successful employee.

### **Collaboration and Communication**

Understanding how workers interact and collaborate is a vital aspect to remember for businesses that still operate remotely.

If you **[work from home](/category/work-from-home/)** or on-site, you&#8217;ll need to collaborate and get along with your coworkers to get things done. That means how a company interacts with one another can have a significant effect on your work satisfaction as well as your level of comfort.
