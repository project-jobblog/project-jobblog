Have you ever received a job offer out of the blue? Have you ever wondered if it&#8217;s a scam or a real one? Maybe you have good reason to be careful. In this tech-obsessed, always-on world, online fraud has become the new reality. Scammers continue to search for soft targets and their ploys are still vulnerable to job seekers.

But how do you discern legitimate offers from sham offerings? Here is a list of tips to help keep you from falling into an online fraud trap.

### The Surprise Offer Letter

And though you have not applied for a position, there are no unseen forces functioning mysteriously to get you an offer letter. So, if you come across an incredibly easy recruitment method in which the work offers land in your inbox without you looking for it, it is most definitely a fraud case. Another version of such a job scam is when you are contacted by a work portal to tell you that your resume has been discovered online and only a short telephone interview is required to obtain the job offer. This is a sure example of an accident waiting to occur.

### Emails which are full of errors

Although this may not be a foolish way of judging a fraud, it also works very efficiently. Scammers/bots&#8217; emails are typically not well-written. More than normal, if you spot spelling errors, grammatical errors, wrong use of punctuation or capitalization, then there is a high likelihood that it is a phishing process.

### Data that applies to your finances

Job sites typically don&#8217;t ask for information about your credit card, not unless you opt for their premium/paid services. And when registering yourself, knowing that you are being cheated if such data is made mandatory. Never give out such data and ensure that you also leave the website.

### Unclear Content

A further indication of a job scam is ambiguous job descriptions and job qualifications. Such content is very specifically defined in the case of a legitimate site and is fairly easy as well. Some inconsistencies with this format and you should be careful.

### Private Information

Job search sites do not require private information such as a social security number, bank account details, or other personal details. Therefore, if the site asks for such information, it may be a job scam, then you should exercise caution.

### Unbalance of salary and work

In this world, there are no free lunches and the same holds true for every work as well. If you are making an offer that needs less effort from you and still gives you an extremely high salary, then it is too good to be true. Thus, before going any further, you can study all aspects of the work.

### If there is a payment involved,

Companies typically outsource to third party companies the candidate identification process. For this, a service fee is often charged to such firms. No organization, however, pays individuals for guaranteed candidate placements, even without the [interview process](/what-to-expect-in-a-final-job-interview/). For overseas placements, such a scam is a normal occurrence.

### Mismatch

In the form of their blogs, social media pages or even as features in news portals, all legitimate businesses have a presence online. You should be careful of such a company if you are being interviewed by a company that you can not find online.

### No Contact Information

If important elements such as the sender&#8217;s signature, company address or phone number are absent from the emails you receive, then there is a fair risk that all the play is a scam.

### Heed Your Instinct

Finally, you can still rely on the feeling in your gut to let you know when something is wrong. This is also relevant for judging the veracity of the potential for the work. If you get the impression that everything is not going as it should, even if everything else checks out, then you must seriously consider walking away from the contract. Bear in mind these tips and remain safe from online scammers.
