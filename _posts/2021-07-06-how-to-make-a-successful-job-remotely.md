How to Make a Successful Job Remotely? There are some things you can do when you first log into the company&#8217;s system to assist you to get off on the right foot, especially if this is your first time working in a remote environment.

### **Get Your Home Office Ready**

If you didn&#8217;t have time to prepare your home office before starting your new remote job, the first day is the ideal opportunity to do so. Make sure you have everything you need to be a successful, efficient, and productive remote worker.

This isn&#8217;t an all-inclusive list, but it might include:

  * Having a setup that is both comfortable and ergonomic
  * Establishing boundaries with friends and family
  * Double-checking that you have the right user names and passwords
  * Inspecting your computer and accessories for functionality and determining whether you require upgrades.

### **Express gratitude to everyone**

As you begin your new work, you will have a lot of questions. While your coworkers are likely to be pleased to help, express your gratitude to everyone who responds to your emails, whether it&#8217;s your boss, another remote worker, or a coworker in the office. Thank you notes are an excellent way to begin creating relationships.

### **Take Care of Yourself**

Don&#8217;t be too hard on yourself when you reflect on your first day as a remote worker in your new role. Even if you didn&#8217;t get all done that you wanted, take a deep breath, relax, and realize that there are many more days ahead of you. Day two will benefit from what you learned the day before, and the process will continue as long as you prepare well, work hard, ask questions, and learn from your mistakes to \[overcome a bad day at work\](How to Overcome A Bad Day At Work).

### **Get a Glimpse of the Situation**

Your new employer has most likely provided you with some information to assist you in getting started. This could comprise a handbook, guidelines, or a list of communication and collaboration programs used by the company.

Start learning about the work and the organization by reading through any relevant resources and knowledge bases. Naturally, if you have any questions, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask!

### **Get to know your coworkers&#8217; preferences**

Your company most likely employs a range of communication tools, including [video conferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony), email, instant messaging, and online chats. It&#8217;s a good idea to start figuring out which coworkers like specific communication channels for different types of queries and tasks on your first day on the job.

### **Modify Your Communication Plan**

If you previously worked in an office, you likely had the opportunity to ask a variety of colleagues questions during your first few days and weeks on the job. It used to be simple to peer over the cubicle wall for assistance, but that won&#8217;t be the case when you work remotely.

Let your boss and coworkers know you&#8217;re online and ready to work on the first day of your new remote job. Then, throughout the day, make sure you&#8217;re available to both ask and answer questions. Don&#8217;t be afraid to overcommunicate because it will help you figure out who can answer which inquiries.

### **Collaborate with coworkers**

Other virtual employees at the organization will be one of your best resources for addressing inquiries about your [new career](/how-to-changing-career-without-losing-your-mind-or-yourself/). Determine who they are and make contact with a couple of them. Tell them about yourself and ask if they have any first-day advice. Their knowledge will likely be useful for months to come.

### **Attend a Couple of Meetings**

While meetings are the misery of the average office worker&#8217;s existence, they can be extremely beneficial when starting a new remote job. Though your manager is likely to plan meetings with key members of your team during your first few days on the job, if they aren&#8217;t, take the initiative and set them up yourself.

### **Expectations to Your Boss**

Your boss isn&#8217;t going to be lurking over your shoulder telling you what you should and shouldn&#8217;t be doing. For the most part, this is a positive thing, but when you&#8217;re starting a new job, it&#8217;s helpful to know what your supervisor expects of you. On your first day, request some time to ensure that you understand their communication, work management, and productivity demands.
