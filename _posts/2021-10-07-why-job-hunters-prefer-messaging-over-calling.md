Great communication between applicants and recruiters has become not just an important aspect of a positive candidate experience, but also a necessity in the twenty-first century. With the advancement of mobile technology and messaging apps, today&#8217;s workforce has come to demand quick and easy communication. That is why so many businesses have installed chatbots on their careers pages or within other messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.

Messaging apps have over 4 billion monthly active users, and texts have a 90% open rate and are frequently read within the first three minutes. Allow me to show you why messaging has grown so popular with the public if you aren&#8217;t already convinced to include it in your recruiting approach.

### **Transparency**

Candidate experience and communication are almost synonymous: bad communication equals bad candidate experience. Many applications go unanswered or are barely acknowledged. It&#8217;s a sad reality that&#8217;s difficult to confront.

Recruiters would love to respond to every prospect that applies, but the harsh reality is that this isn&#8217;t always possible. This is where automation may help: a lack of time should not be used as an excuse for a poor candidate experience… all you need are the correct tools.

Recruiters can use messaging to automate key phases in the application process, freeing up time for essential communications that improve the candidate experience. Here are some of the most important administrative activities that can be delegated to a chatbot:

  * Using a tailored job search, guiding individuals to their perfect open positions.
  * Make the application procedure as simple as possible.
  * Candidates should be able to arrange and reschedule their own interviews.
  * Send interview reminders to candidates.
  * Inform applicants about the status of their applications.
  * Begin the process of onboarding.

Overall, providing a huge opportunity for companies to provide transparency to candidates.

### **Speed**

Messaging is a quick and easy way to communicate with your candidates in real time. Candidates will be able to communicate with candidates 24 hours a day, seven days a week when you combine instant messaging with automation in a chatbot frame.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

### **Value**

Message candidates instead of calling to demonstrate that you value their time. Because candidates&#8217; lifestyles are diverse and busy, messaging is the preferred method of communication during the recruiting process. Remember that the courtesy you provide to applicants throughout the earliest phases will help them have a better overall candidate experience.

A phone conversation may be required at some point throughout the interview process or to finalize more specific details; however, taking the time to message all initial interactions and scheduling a call when the candidate is ready will ensure a nice encounter. As a result, when contacting applicants for the first time, using instant chat or emails will make them feel more important and raise their enthusiasm for your organization.

### **Personal**

Millennials prefer getting SMS than calls because they believe it is more personal. As previously stated, messaging enhances emotions of worth and control, which will boost the perception that this choice is personalized to the candidate, taking into consideration their schedules, preferences, and allowing them to make decisions about their application.

When it comes to recruiting, this personal touch is crucial, as many candidates believe the process is too impersonal, geared toward the masses rather than the individual. Switching from phone conversations to texting could be a simple way to improve the applicant experience and make the entire process feel more personalized.

The only difficulty is that messaging can improve your candidate experience and increase the amount of qualified leads. Recruiters have to spend more time messaging. What is the solution? Investing in messaging software like SmartPal, which provides the type of communications millennial prospects seek, could lead to better hires.

### **Control**

We&#8217;ve all experienced the frustration of someone attempting to contact us via phone rather than email or text (which may lead to a call, but only if it is necessary). As technology has progressed, this gut intuition has been progressively transforming the way we interact.

So, what&#8217;s the deal with people&#8217;s aversion to phone talks in favor of text or instant messaging? Numerous studies have found that people find phone calls invasive and less personal, because the caller values his or her time over the recipient&#8217;s.

Candidates have more control over their answer and schedule when they text. These thoughtfulness and respect touch points are particularly crucial in the recruitment process, which is typically stressful and opaque to candidates.
