Video interviews have been more popular in recent years as more companies recognize the value of including a visual element in the first stages of the recruitment process. Some people, on the other hand, haven&#8217;t felt obliged to use this method yet.

If you&#8217;re one of them, you should read these reasons why video interviews make a difference and will continue to do so in the future when evaluating prospects.



### **There is no problem with geography**

The fact that video interviews have no geographical constraints why they are the way of the future.

You can still interview when you&#8217;re away from the workplace if you&#8217;re attending a conference 100 miles away. Similarly, there exist talent shortages in specific businesses and domains of competence.

Finding a web developer in a small village, for example, isn&#8217;t always possible. As a result, remote working becomes a requirement.

Your company can also conduct video interviews to go along with this. Just make sure you&#8217;re connected to the internet!

### **Reduce the number of no-shows**

Today, interview no-shows are a serious problem. Because there are so many other options available, it&#8217;s easy for a candidate to change their mind.

By separating the serious and passive job applicants, video interviewing can lower the risk.

Giving the candidate the freedom to choose a time and day for the video interview removes any excuse for them to miss their scheduled slot because it is on their terms. If they do miss it, you won&#8217;t have wasted as many hours as you would with a traditional interview.

Opening up the communication line on a visible basis right away will give you an indication of who is serious about landing this job and who isn&#8217;t. You can cut your losses sooner rather than later if the applicant is only going through the motions. You can also set aside time for after-hours interviews, which is a huge plus for job seekers.

Video interviewing, on the other hand, allows you to see who meets and exceeds expectations. It&#8217;s a better method to form a more well-rounded opinion of someone before making a decision.

Having a video recording allows you to go back and review what each candidate said. You already have a million things on your mind, so it&#8217;s easy to overlook some of their points when they&#8217;re speaking.

### **Increased speed**

One of the main reasons why video interviews are the way of the future is the ease with which they may be conducted. A lot of CVs appear to be rather impressive at first glance. However, interviewing dozens of people at once is a waste of time and resources.

Using video interviewing at the beginning of the process allows you to engage with prospects much more quickly, making them feel valued and as if you&#8217;re actively attempting to develop a relationship with them.

It will allow you to see and hear what the candidate has to say during a brief phone interview. While **phone interviews** might be beneficial, they do not always provide a clear picture of the candidate&#8217;s body language.

Do they have a friendly demeanor and a lot of smiles? When you ask them a difficult question, do they make erratic hand movements and appear nervous? You can get a sense of a candidate&#8217;s personality without committing to a lengthy face-to-face interview.

### **No need to waste time**

Humans, let&#8217;s face it, are judgmental. Most of us can determine whether or not a candidate is a good fit in a matter of seconds.

The advantage of video interviews is that they eliminate the need to prolong the inevitable. They should only take a few minutes to complete, so if you&#8217;re not impressed, you won&#8217;t be forced to sit through a 30-minute face-to-face interview!

### **There will be more eyeballs on the candidates**

It&#8217;s a logistical nightmare to try to get stakeholders and management to agree on a precise day and time. With video interviews, having everything recorded allows everyone to assess the candidate at their leisure.

This not only simplifies your life, but it also helps to eliminate any conscious or subconscious bias from the decision-making process by involving more people throughout the assessment step.

### **Obtain a true reflection of a person**

Face-to-face interviews are nerve-wracking and intimidating. Video interviews, on the other hand, can lighten the mood and put people at ease.

They won&#8217;t have to worry about finding your office or engaging in talk with your coworkers. Instead, they&#8217;re relaxing in their own house.

As a result, they should be more open and honest in their responses to your questions. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity to build a relationship with them right away and improve the candidate experience.

### **Final thoughts**

Video interviewing has numerous advantages. While it may appear to be an extra step in the hiring process, it can save you money in the long run by increasing your chances of hiring a top applicant who will stay with your company for a longer period of time.

Keep all video interviews brief at first, until you feel comfortable expanding on them with more questions. Over time, you&#8217;ll develop a solid approach that&#8217;s essential to your hiring process.
