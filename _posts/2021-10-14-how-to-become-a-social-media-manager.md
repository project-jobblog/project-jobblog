### **What Is the Role of a Social Media Manager?**

Managing social media appears to be a simple chore, but it can be rather difficult and typically involves more than just publishing photographs to a company&#8217;s site. What is the role of a social media manager? It turns out that they accomplish quite a bit!

Social media managers are in charge of a business&#8217;s overall social media presence and personality. They raise brand awareness, communicate with people on social media, and help the company, organization, or agency project a favorable, well-received image. Everything from defining the overarching plan to actively posting on various sites is done by them. They also keep track of metrics, assign roles, and set user interaction goals.

The design, posting, and monitoring of social media platforms are, nonetheless, the core responsibilities of a social media manager. This could entail things like scheduling postings, writing copy for various websites, and working with employees to develop content for the platforms.

They are usually in charge of developing the entire marketing strategy before actively publishing to social media (or assigning this responsibility to someone else). The general goals will be the starting point for this strategy. What&#8217;s the point of all these announcements? Is it just to boost overall brand awareness, produce more leads for salespeople, or increase sales numbers? Once the aim has been established, a social media manager will develop the overall plan, which will include the types of posts to be generated, the demographics to be targeted, the sites to be used, and the frequency with which individuals will post to the sites.

A social media manager wants to know if their efforts are paying off. As a result, they will do data analysis and attempt to draw conclusions about their efforts. The number of followers, click-throughs (when social media users click on your links), and comments are all examples of this data.

These are the general social media management responsibilities that come with the profession. However, there may be other tasks, such as:

  * Interacting with consumers on the company&#8217;s behalf
  * Keeping up with the most recent social media sites
  * Editing or evaluating posts before they are published in their final form.
  * Working with graphic designers, authors, and web developers.

Clearly, they help a lot of businesses and organizations. These social media manager responsibilities can be demanding, requiring both creativity and technical expertise. They necessitate a working grasp of numbers as well as an interest in other people. While schooling is vital for this field, you also need the necessary abilities to satisfy the top social media manager credentials.

### **Social Media Manager Overview**

Knowing how to become a social media manager isn&#8217;t enough; you also need to know if you&#8217;ll enjoy working in this field. As we&#8217;ll see, this is a demanding but unique vocation that presents interesting challenges on a daily basis.

**Advantages of Working as a Social Media Manager**

The process of becoming a social media manager is quite straightforward, and there are numerous advantages to doing so. The majority of people love the creative flexibility they have in this sector.

Of course, because you work for a firm or an organization, you can&#8217;t just share your own odd thoughts, artwork, or musings. You do, however, get to employ your creativity on a daily basis through design, writing, and communication.

However, the degree of creative freedom will differ. You&#8217;ll be able to work independently on some assignments, giving yourself complete creative flexibility to achieve your objectives. On some jobs, you may be given a set of instructions that are exceedingly strict and inflexible, which may stifle your creative spirit. However, you&#8217;ll almost certainly get the opportunity to exercise your creative muscles on most assignments.

Another benefit is the opportunity to work on a range of projects for a number of companies in various industries. Manufacturing, retail, real estate, human resources, education, software, construction, social outreach, and a variety of other industries may be among your clients if you work for a marketing firm. This provides a level of variation that is uncommon in other professions.

**Disadvantages of Working as a Social Media Manager**

Being a social media manager has its drawbacks, just like any other job. You&#8217;ll have to deal with a wide range of unpleasant situations and challenges in this line of work. People want you to produce excellent results right away, but they may not comprehend the complexities of online marketing and social media management; they may anticipate sales to soar quickly after the first post, not recognizing that building a brand&#8217;s reputation takes time. When asked &#8220;what is a social media manager?&#8221; many individuals, quite bluntly, have no idea, which may be frustrating in and of itself.

You must also deal with a constantly changing set of social media channels. A new site appears to be the next Facebook one day, then vanishes into internet oblivion the next. This can be aggravating, but many people appreciate the diversity that comes with learning a new system on a regular basis.

### **How Much Do Social Media Managers Make?**

A social media manager&#8217;s pay is difficult to estimate. This is due to the fact that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is widely considered as the authority on wage, job growth, and other employment statistics, does not collect data on &#8220;social media managers.&#8221; Fortunately, a few websites exist that do.

According to three prominent job-search sites, the following are the average wages for social media managers:

  * According to Glassdoor, the average salary is $54,268.
  * Payscale: $52,298
  * [According to Salary.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/social-media-manager-salary-SRCH_KO0,20.htm), salaries range from $42,870 to $55,350.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not have statistics on social media managers, but it does have data on public relations specialists. While there are some differences and common talents, there are enough similarities and shared skills to provide insight into the general need for people with these skills. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a PR expert earned median annual pay of $62,810 in May 2020.

Earnings will vary, so if you&#8217;re wondering how much do social media managers make, you&#8217;ll find a wide variety. The more experience and talent you have, as well as the more you study social media management, the more money you may expect to make. However, based on the figures above, it appears that most social media managers can expect a good salary.
