It&#8217;s natural to feel insecure when job hunting, but it&#8217;s also natural to want to do whatever it takes to escape that feeling. No one enjoys exposing themselves to the risk of harm or in this case, rejection.

Although becoming vulnerable can be frightening or stressful, meeting your fears can actually aid you in your job search. Rather than putting your guard up, admit when you&#8217;ve reached a snag, seek guidance, and embrace assistance. You don&#8217;t have to do it by yourself.

Here are suggestions for turning your insecurity into an asset and landing your [dream job](/things-to-know-before-quitting-your-job-to-follow-your-dreams/).

### **Improve your listening abilities**

Were you paying attention as job search tips came from career mentors, interviewers, former employers, and friends? It can be difficult to admit that we need advice from all of these people, but now is the time to do so. They can be a great source of new ideas that you hadn&#8217;t considered before.

Concentrate on honing your listening skills now that you&#8217;ve encouraged yourself to be a little more vulnerable and stopped resisting support from others. Meetings with people in your network who can help you succeed in your job search can be extremely beneficial. Everything you have to do is be open to listening.

### **Admit that you are deserving**

We often think we aren&#8217;t eligible for the job we want, particularly if the circumstances that led to our job search have lowered our self-esteem. But don&#8217;t be too harsh on yourself.

According to research , 42 percent of resumes received by HR managers are from applicants that do not meet the job criteria. Even better, 84 percent said their organization is open to recruiting someone who can improve their skills through training.

This demonstrates that you can get a job even though you don&#8217;t fulfill all of the requirements. All you have to do now is admit your shortcomings and tell the hiring manager you&#8217;re ready to learn on the job.

### **Don&#8217;t turn down deals**

Accepting help when it is given is often part of being insecure. Many job seekers believe that accepting assistance in landing a job means they haven&#8217;t truly won the role. This, however, is not the case.

When anyone offers to assist you with your job search, take them up on it! You&#8217;re just damaging yourself when you decide you&#8217;re too proud, don&#8217;t want to be a burden, or the timing isn&#8217;t correct. It&#8217;s important to remember that seeking assistance from others is not a sign of weakness.

Accept the offer to have your resume checked. Take a look at the job posting your friend forwarded to you. Meet up with a coworker of a friend who works at your dream company. You never know what could happen if you take advantage of these opportunities.

### **Identify the prevention strategies**

We all have strategies for avoiding circumstances that make us feel uneasy. Consider the following scenario:

  * occupying yourself with insignificant tasks
  * Spending the whole weekend in bed
  * Leaving messages on voicemail
  * avoiding eye contact during interactions

Try to find out how you escape situations. You&#8217;ll be able to tell when you&#8217;re doing them this way. Then, instead of slipping back into habits that aren&#8217;t [improving your job search](/simple-ways-on-how-to-improve-your-job-search/), motivate yourself to make a shift the next time you find yourself avoiding a stressor.

Allow yourself to network with people in your ideal industry or business and share knowledge. Make an effort to get outside of your comfort zone. As a job seeker, you can only succeed if you allow yourself to be vulnerable.

### **Be willing to accept constructive criticism**

Along with good advice, there will be some criticism. It is undeniably difficult to accept criticism in any situation. It can feel much worse if you&#8217;re already a vulnerable job seeker.

Although you don&#8217;t have to follow every piece of advice you get, now isn&#8217;t the time to dismiss your critics. When anyone gives you negative feedback, keep an open mind because this is always where you&#8217;ll discover something new.

Listen to people who are willing to work with you and teach you how to develop your resume, interview skills, or job search strategy. You might have what it takes to land the position if you can handle the feedback and focus on improving your job search.

Accept your vulnerability; you are deserving of your dream job and will be able to find it.
