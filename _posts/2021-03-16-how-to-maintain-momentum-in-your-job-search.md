COVID-19 has certainly delivered a lot of anxiety into every aspect of our daily lives. All is not lost if you&#8217;ve been laid off or furloughed, or if you&#8217;re unhappy in your job but feel compelled to stick it out for a while longer.

We&#8217;ve outlined steps below to help you organize yourself, get started, and maintain momentum during this trying time.

### **Make a Plan**

It&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to take a deep breath, collect your thoughts, and devise a job search strategy. In fact, doing some research and planning ahead of time will likely make your job search go faster and be more successful.

**Consider the following:**

  * Can you keep doing what you&#8217;re doing now, or do you need to think about and make a career change?
  * What jobs are available in the near and long term?
  * Who would be the best employers for you to work for? Do you have any acquaintances who work for those companies?
  * What are the job requirements and titles used by these employers for the position you want? Do you meet those criteria, or do you need to obtain additional credentials or experience? Is it possible to gain that experience by volunteering or enrolling in a class?

Because the goal is not clear in the resumes, LinkedIn profile, and networking, a job search that has no target, that is &#8220;open&#8221; to anything, takes longer today. When you concentrate on one thing, you can get a lot more done.

### **Get Your Finances in Order and Search for a Secure Gap Job**

It&#8217;s now or never to figure out what you can cut, what you can put on credit, and so on. The aim is to make your money go as far for as long as possible.

There&#8217;s no shame in working a gig of any type to get you through this difficult time to keep the lights on, just as there was no shame in working a gig during the 2008 Financial Crisis when people in  banking, financial services, and real estate were hit hard.

Among the many businesses hiring are grocery stores, courier systems, fast food, big box shopping, healthcare, interactive teaching, and remote communications companies.

### **Take charge of what you can**

No matter how you look at it, the new [#coronalife](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23coronalife) is stressful. With so much out of our control, concentrate on what we can control – and look for new opportunities where none previously existed.

### **Develop Your Remote Interviewing Skills**

Face-to-face interviews have mostly been replaced by video and [phone interviews](/how-to-prepare-for-a-phone-interview/). The benefit is that you can practice using recording software tools like Zoom, Skype, UberConference, Google Hangouts or Meet, or even Facebook Video and iPhone Facetime to record and see how you sound and look.

**A few pointers:**

  * If you don&#8217;t have a lamp or another light source in front of you, you&#8217;ll look silhouetted.
  * Hold your eyes on the camera rather than the computer screen.
  * Use a box or set your laptop up on antable so that the camera on your monitor is at eye level. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll seem to have a double chin when you don&#8217;t.
  * Take a look at how your clothing colors appear on video. Avoid black and white and everything with large patterns, and instead opt for jewel tones or pastel shades, as TV professionals do.

### **Get Your Career Materials in Order**

This is an excellent time to update your [resume](/category/resume-tips/), which means they must be current in content, format, and keyword optimization.

Using tools like [JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/) to make sure your resume contain the most keywords available, giving your documents the best chance of performing well when Candidate Tracking Software systems and algorithms are in play.

### **Research the Employers and the Positions**

Keep track of new job openings by checking LinkedIn with the hashtags #hiringnow, #coronavirushiring, and #hiring, as posts are coming in by the hour.

Review press releases, hear about company rewards, goods and services, executives and other team members, and the latest news on an employer&#8217;s website. For those with a little more time on their hands, now is as good a time as any to perform in-depth research into positions and companies of interest.

If asking a stranger about this sounds odd, consider reaching out to your university or corporate alum network.

### **Make new acquaintances**

We&#8217;re all spending more time together in our new COVID-19 shelter in place lockdown, and people online are likely to be more open to communicating.

This is an excellent time to contact people you meet like your former employers, suppliers, colleagues, and customers, as well as people you need or want to know.

### **Conclusion**

With the Coronavirus pandemic, things have changed, and some of those changes are undoubtedly permanent. We will thrive if we will — and must — adapt to this new environment.
