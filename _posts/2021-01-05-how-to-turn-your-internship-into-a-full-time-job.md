Before taking those first steps down your career path, internships are a great way to gain practical, first-hand work experience. Not only are these experiences beneficial over time, but they also provide the ability to develop expertise and network with individuals employed in one&#8217;s chosen sector. Plus, it&#8217;s probably the perfect time to learn the most about your industry, while with a prospective employer having your foot in the door as well.

In fact, as a testing ground for potential hires, many employers use internship programs. So if you&#8217;re about to begin an internship, or if you&#8217;re an intern already, here are a few tips that can help you turn that internship into a full-time job.

  * Be resourceful
  * Have a positive attitude
  * Don&#8217;t be a wallflower
  * Always take initiative

If you can, you must arrive on time, or early! â€” every day. Before they begin, they arrive for meetings, finish each task by their deadlines, and always go the extra mile. This is a key success factor and also provides early impressions of your outlook and dedication to work, giving it all.

### Be Resourceful

The ability to solve problems quickly is one of the traits that most employers look for in an employee. Before taking a problem to your supervisor, make sure you look for all the possible resources and responses when working on a task or assisting someone with an assignment. Asking questions that demonstrate that you have not done enough research is a strict no-no. So take a deep dive into the subject instead of saying, **&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;** read thoroughly and take the time to reflect and try to come up with your own insights. This will usually assist you in finding a solution, but if it doesn&#8217;t, then ask for help by all means.

### Have a positive attitude

As an intern, you are not expected to know how to do it all, so don&#8217;t let your mistakes pull you down. Make the most of this short period and ask questions that are meaningful. Be conscious of your environment and absorb as much as you can. Stay positive, and remember that based on how you respond to an unpleasant situation, your colleagues and managers may make a hiring decision about you.

### Don&#8217;t be a wallflower

We can&#8217;t stress enough about this. Speak up and make suggestions. This is your chance to sell your credentials, skills, and ideas, so don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just because you&#8217;re an intern that your opinion is not valued. Share it if you have an idea.

### Always take initiative

Make sure you take the initiative in order to stand out from the rest of the inner pool. Ask if any of your colleagues need any help when you&#8217;re done with your assignments or let your manager know that you&#8217;re available to take on more work. If you&#8217;ve got a great idea for a new project, share it by all means.

Your ability to demonstrate that you are prepared to move forward and do more than what you were originally allocated will demonstrate how much of an asset you would be to the team. You will demonstrate how committed you really are to your work by exceeding expectations.
