We will all have to apply for our first job at some point in our lives, and when we do, it&#8217;s likely that experience will be one of the prerequisites for the work. But how are you expected to get experience if, first of all, no one is going to hire you? It is an age-old problem that today continues to frustrate and bemuse jobseekers.

Luckily, this career roadblock has many ways to negotiate. With a bit of studying, some old-fashioned grit and dedication, and no small amount of patience, there&#8217;s no excuse why you shouldn&#8217;t take the first steps on the career ladder. So, if you&#8217;re a school leaver, a graduate, or a student, and you&#8217;re ready to step into the big, bad world of work, here&#8217;s how to get an experience-free job.

### **_Volunteer_**

If you want a more realistic approach to gaining experience, then volunteering can have a profoundly positive effect on your CV. There are many other advantages, aside from the abilities you can learn in the job you do . depending, of course, on where you volunteer, For instance, it shows your selflessness and commitment to making a difference in the lives of other people, while it also demonstrates to employers that you are a proactive candidate.

If you are extremely committed to a certain area or occupation, and your circumstances allow it, you may even approach and ask for shadowing of certain individuals or departments. As well as the industry experience you will obtain and the future networking opportunities you will gain, when you come to apply for a job, your commitment and dedication will set you well apart from your rivals. Who knows? If you manage to impress, you might even directly land yourself an offer!

### **_Seek For Jobs Elsewhere_**

In your work hunt, if you keep getting knockback after knockback, then you will have to re-adjust your standards at some point. If you&#8217;re struggling to break into a sales position, for instance, then think outside of the box. Find a place that needs no previous experience, such as at a fast food restaurant, and concentrate on improving your skills in [customer service](/signs-a-career-in-customer-service-is-for-you/). Then, after a further six months, when you apply again, you will be able to prove that you have gone out into the world and built up your experience.

In your temporary employment, don&#8217;t just go through the motions, either. It&#8217;s possible that your shift manager or boss will be asked for a reference after you&#8217;ve left, so preserve a positive mindset and work hard. After all, you can still earn cash, and while it might not be the perfect scenario, think of it as just one step on the long path to career success.

### **_Internships and apprenticeships_**

As policymakers look for new ways of solving skill shortages, apprenticeships are making a resurgent comeback, not just in the conventional context of professionalism. Many prestigious white-collar organizations now offer &#8216;office-based&#8217; apprenticeships, particularly in the financial sector, as do many major technology players and engineering giants.

If you&#8217;re looking for a way into one of these firms, then the best match is an apprenticeship. They are specifically designed for people with no prior experience in the industry, and when you are educated by the company, you will get paid a salary. Depending on your level of education, there are different kinds of apprenticeships, too, so do your homework and see what&#8217;s available. Meanwhile, internships are also a viable way to get experience while being paid, but at the end of your placement there is no guarantee of a permanent position unlike apprenticeships. However, as a way to get a big name on your CV, it is a highly useful and recommended route to take.

### **_Sell Yourself Differently_**

When existing professionals apply for employment, recruiters take into account a multitude of variables, especially their experience and accomplishments. However, because you are an entry-level nominee, your CV will be scrutinized differently. Employers know that your work experience will be limited in most situations, so they are more concerned with whether you have the right combination of features and personality traits to succeed in the job. These characteristics are known as soft skills and can be transferred in any industry.

Can you work as part of a team, for instance? Are you a good communicator? Are you adept at decision making? To have developed and shown these talents, you don&#8217;t have to have any work experience. For example, you may have been part of a sports team at school or a public speaker at college. The argument is that, taking into account the situations of your life where you&#8217;ve used them, you should concentrate on promoting these soft skills.

Try to concentrate on the job&#8217;s specifications themselves, too. If you&#8217;re supposed to work a lot alone, prove how accountable and independent you are; sell your communication skills if you&#8217;re working with clients. Always know what your employers are looking for and accordingly promote your [soft skills](/tips-on-how-to-improve-your-soft-skills-at-work/).

### **_Build and Use you&#8217;re Networks_**

It&#8217;s an undeniable fact when it comes to having a job because, in many situations, it&#8217;s not what you know, but rather who you know. You should not, therefore, underestimate the value of developing a strong network of contacts. Luckily, there are many ways of doing this, even without any job experience. Make sure that you are active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), follow pages that are important to your profession and interact with recruiters in businesses for which you would like to work.

Show off your portfolio , for instance, if you&#8217;re an aspiring artist, then share the pieces you write. You never know who&#8217;s going to read them, and they could only get in touch if they&#8217;re impressed. If you&#8217;re a student or a graduate, make use of the career resources and alumni network of your university, as well as your faculty staff. Do not ignore your extended friends and family&#8217;s networking possibilities, either; all it takes is one well-placed second aunt to pull a few strings, and you might end up with an interview at a top company.

### **_Become Relentless_**

If you really want an entry-level vacancy, but you don&#8217;t have the requisite experience for it, then you can sometimes compensate for this by impressing recruiters in other ways. Don&#8217;t just go through the online application motions like everyone else; by setting yourself apart, prove how badly you want the job. Do your study, for example, and find out who will be the head of your prospective department, as well as who is the senior HR recruiter at the organization.

Then give them customized cover letters describing why you will be so well suited to the role and sharing how passionate you are. This will not only make you more unforgettable, but it will also illustrate that you are willing to be proactive and use your initiative. You would have made a good impression, even if this does not succeed and you don&#8217;t get an interview, and your integrity and dedication will reflect well on you. Besides, you can never get anywhere, as in all things in life, unless you take a chance and put yourself out there.

It is difficult to get a job when you have no experience; at times, it may seem like an increasingly vicious circle. One chance to break the cycle is all you need, though, and get your foot on the proverbial ladder, and everything will fall into place. You will, hopefully, do just that by following these tips, and begin to earn money and grow your career in no time.
