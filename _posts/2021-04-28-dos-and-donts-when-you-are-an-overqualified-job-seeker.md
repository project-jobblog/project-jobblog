Rest assured that there will always be an overqualified job seeker or applicants who do not ideally match the position&#8217;s mold during the interview process.

But what happens if you&#8217;re an overqualified job seeker? It&#8217;s critical to emphasize how and why your skill set will be beneficial to the business, but it can be difficult to do so without seeming too ambitious.

Regardless of how long your resume is, follow these Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts to help you find a fulfilling career with new challenges.

### **Don&#8217;t Talk About Money**

Among overqualified candidates, this may be the [most difficult issue](http://hbr.org/2010/12/the-myth-of-the-overqualified-worker/ar/1). Keep in mind that just because you&#8217;ve earned more money than you&#8217;re looking for doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re the best candidate.

Often direct the discussion away from past salary and toward skills and experiences. If your interviewer is worried that you&#8217;re more of a flight risk because of the lower pay, emphasize your past work experience of loyalty or longevity.

### **Don&#8217;t Undersell Yourself**

Even if your ability set exceeds what the interviewer is looking for, that doesn&#8217;t mean you can leave anything out. Don&#8217;t be afraid to include items that aren&#8217;t related to your career.

A genuinely qualified candidate would possess not only subject-matter knowledge, but also a positive attitude and extracurricular activities that will attract a hiring manager. Hiding all of your numerous assets could turn him or her off and persuade them that you aren&#8217;t a good match, which will only set your career back.

Mention previous experiences with an organization where you matured and changed, such as promotions or awards.

This will demonstrate your desire to work hard in a lower-level role without suggesting that you will be content to begin small.

### **Don&#8217;t Show Desperation**

It&#8217;s true that many job seekers are looking &#8220;behind&#8221; their desired positions in this economy, but pointing this out will do you no favors.

Your involvement in the work alone demonstrates that you want it, and now it&#8217;s up to you to prove your competence. Instead of a lengthy job history that may or may not be important, the **resume and cover letter can be tweaked to highlight main experiences relevant to the role**.

Without suggesting that you&#8217;re &#8220;slumming it&#8221; by applying, be forthright in describing how and why you&#8217;ll be a great fit for this specific company.

### **Be Honest**

It&#8217;s probably obvious that you&#8217;re putting too much emphasis on credentials for the ideal role. This isn&#8217;t always a negative thing. Although it&#8217;s not necessary to state flatly that you&#8217;re overqualified, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to mention your abilities, even if they&#8217;re extensive.

Honesty in this area can impress a hiring manager, who will be delighted to hire someone who is clearly a fast and intelligent learner.

### **Have a Positive Attitude**

In an interview, excitement is a valuable asset. During an interview, interviewers quickly weed out prospective hires who are less-than-stellar. Your credentials may have gotten you in the threshold, but it&#8217;s your attitude that will stay with a potential employer.

Explain any related life events or moments in your professional life from which you think you learned valuable lessons.

Interviewing animated, entertaining people is a lot of fun, and you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to sell yourself instead of your skills.

### **Make every effort to find a suitable position**

Seeking a job is difficult enough; finding the right job is almost impossible. Make every effort to find positions that fit your resume as closely as possible, while resisting the temptation to settle for something unsatisfactory.

Your expertise may be more advanced than what a young startup seeks, but your skills will benefit any employer. A great employer would want to surround themselves with experts who can help their team shine.

Overqualified job seeker sometimes outperforms their peers and have no higher quit rate than coworkers with less experience.

Assuaging the interviewer&#8217;s concerns can be as simple as seeing the ideal work as a rewarding challenge rather than a temporary fix.

On the other hand, attempting to work in a field unrelated to your previous job may result in your resume being rejected outright. You might get an interview for a job with lower pay than you&#8217;re used to, but an employee who works hard and rises through the ranks quickly can.
