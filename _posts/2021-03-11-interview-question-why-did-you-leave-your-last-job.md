When looking for a new career, you should be prepared to justify why you&#8217;re a free agent to a hiring manager. some reasons you leave your job include &#8220;additional obligation, increased compensation, and relocation.&#8221; You may also justify your resume holes by claiming that you took time off to raise a family or return to school. After a period of economic hardship, even being laid off no longer carries the stigma it once did.

Many people, on the other hand, leave for more personal reasons, such as being unable to cope with a yelling boss, feeling trapped in a dead-end job, or being tired of receiving bad treatment. When you go to your next job interview, you&#8217;ll have to find a way to spin why you wanted to say, &#8220;I quit!&#8221; in a positive light.

That&#8217;s because the last thing you want is for your interviewer to think you&#8217;re a quitter who couldn&#8217;t handle the pressure, wasn&#8217;t a team player, or was difficult to manage. This is how you can justify why you left your previous job without scaring off recruiters.

### **You resigned from a stressful job because you were burnt out**

So you&#8217;re in the middle of an interview, and the hiring manager casually asks, &#8220;Why did you quit your last job?&#8221; Take a deep breath. Do not go on a rant about how you were supposed to work 70 hours a week or how your boss expected you to respond to emails at 10 p.m.

Instead, say something like, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a job that will allow me to put my skills and experience to good use while still allowing me to spend time with my family and friends.&#8221; I agree that we do best when we strike a balanced [work-life balance](/category/work-life-balance/).”

Many employers are embracing—and even demanding—work/life balance, so concentrate on the type of workplace you excel in.

An interviewer should be happy with that answer if you have no other holes on your resume and a track record of working with businesses for long periods of time.

### **You had to leave to care for a family member or a health problem**

Your responsibility to your wellbeing and loved ones is at the top of the list of good reasons to leave a job. Although you don&#8217;t have to go into detail if you took a [Family and Medical Leave Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) and then didn&#8217;t return to work until your 12-week period expired, you can provide the interviewer with some main details.

You should explain that this was a one-time problem that has now been fixed, and that the case does not represent a trend. A [hiring manager](https://www.jobssearches.org/searches/keyword-hiring-manager/location-united-states) won&#8217;t be concerned that they&#8217;ll hire you just to fire you after a few months.

### **You&#8217;re hoping to get a raise or a promotion**

Career progression is high on the list of good reasons for quitting a job. Why remain if there&#8217;s no sign of your career progressing, no new tasks, no new skills to master, and no increase on the horizon? However, there is a way to say it in an interview without sounding bitter.

Instead, say that you&#8217;ve hit your position&#8217;s growth limit and are ready for the next opportunity. This gives your departure an optimistic twist, and the word &#8220;challenge&#8221; means that you will work hard.

Here are a few more general tips to bear in mind if you&#8217;re resigning from a job for some reason:

  * **Less is better in this case.** Give just enough details to justify why you&#8217;re leaving without going into too much detail.
  * **Be truthful.** Although you should definitely frame your departure in a positive light, you can never outright lie about what happened.
  * **Don&#8217;t stray from the subject.** Just share information that is important to the organization and role you are applying for.

### **You didn&#8217;t agree with the ethics of your previous employer**

There are occasions when resigning from a job is the best decision you might make, such as when you find things that are in violation of basic ethics, if not the law. You don&#8217;t want a shady company to tarnish your credibility (or your resume).

If your business doesn&#8217;t respect integrity or following the rules, prospective employers are likely to believe you don&#8217;t.

However, criticizing your former boss (even though it is well-deserved) would not go over well.

Instead, try to focus the conversation on the ideals that you and this new potential employer share. It&#8217;s fine to bring up legitimate high-level disputes with management, but you should present their line of reasoning as well as why you strongly disagree.

Then turn your attention on what you appreciate about the organization you&#8217;re interviewing with, such as their commitment to diversity and inclusion or their efforts to be environmentally conscious. This will also allow you to demonstrate that you completed your homework.

### **You were in need of a transition**

Is it that you really couldn&#8217;t take what you were doing anymore that you&#8217;re changing careers? If that&#8217;s the case, that&#8217;s probably not the right way to explain that to a potential employer. Instead, say something like, &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for ways to put my newly learned [web design](https://www.webdevpl.us) skills to good use&#8221; or whatever new passion or old interest you want to tap into.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
Again, potential employers are searching for consistency, so do your best to show that you&#8217;re not only applying for this job on the spur of the moment, but that you&#8217;ve done your homework and done your research to ensure that this is what you want.

### **Show off your abilities**

If you consider a few (or more) of the above reasons you leave your job, you can make an exit strategy as soon as possible. A solid resume that highlights your accomplishments is one way to get started on the right foot. If an employer is pleased with your resume, it will help concentrate attention on the information you want to share: your skills and experience.

In two business days, you&#8217;ll receive thorough reviews, including a summary of your resume&#8217;s presentation and material, as well as a forecast of a recruiter&#8217;s first impression. It&#8217;s a simple and fast way to make a [good first impression](/how-to-make-a-great-impression-at-work/) and smooth out any wrinkles in your work history.
