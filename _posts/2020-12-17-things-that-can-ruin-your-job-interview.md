For several reasons, job candidates are rejected from job applications. Lying on your CV, hitting the top of the late list, unprepared or underprepared. Then there are people who are being overconfident and rude, destroy their chances, while some others are cast aside due to their lack of social skills or simply because they seem too nervous.

## **These are the things that can ruin your job interview**

### The Handshake

There is nothing worse than a handshake that is limp, frail, and awkward. Since when you meet the hiring manager or your future boss, it&#8217;s the first thing you do, you have to nail it to [make the right impression](/how-to-make-a-great-impression-at-work/).

To reach out first, lock eyes, get the correct grip (not too tight), and hold on tightly for a few seconds, is the secret to a winning handshake.

### Lack of eye contact

When it comes to judging an applicant, every hiring manager can tell you how important eye contact is. It demonstrates that you&#8217;re optimistic (just the right amount), interested in the work, and can hold your own among the company&#8217;s important people. Try not to stare at your interviewer after having said that, or you&#8217;re likely to come across as a creep.

Usually, if interview nerves cause you to avert your eyes, then practice or film yourself in front of a mirror to see how you can build on it.

### Wearing the proper attire

A significant part of your nonverbal contact is your dress code. Wearing the right outfit will not instantly guarantee you the job on the [day of your interview](/what-to-expect-in-a-final-job-interview/), but it will make the right first impression, and help you stand out.

Try to keep your outfit choices easy, reasonable and elegant, as a rule. Often, take the time to make sure you look healthy, keep your nails clean, and keep your teeth stuck with no food.

### Bad mouthing with your old boss

So things ended on a sour note with your former employer, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re publicly airing your dirty linen. Complaining will hurt your chances, even in jest, and make the interviewer turn off.

Keep it professional and to the point, if asked about your previous job experience.

### Small talk

It may not be part of the main questionnaire, but it is important to develop a relationship with your interviewer and to prove that you are a good cultural fit for the organization.

Take advantage of the lighter moments to develop a personal relationship with the person interviewing you, whether it&#8217;s about your weekend plans or your TV watching habits.
