Workers in the entry-level job have the opportunity to learn new skills in a new field while also developing technical talents that they may lack. This employment is ideal for retirees, those who have been unemployed for a long time, or those who want to change careers.

Many retirees have already had a high-stress job and would like to continue working without the added worry of being in control. Some people may find that retirement provides them with the financial comfort they require to attempt something new. Entry-level jobs allow you to develop new abilities while remaining active and involved in your community.

**Here are a few key tips for finding entry-level jobs:**


### **Focus on soft skills**

For entry-level roles, hiring managers look for a variety of attributes. There will be a greater emphasis on soft skills rather than [hard skills](/why-do-hard-skills-matter/). As a result, you should make sure that your resume emphasizes the most important qualities and that they can be used in every position.
