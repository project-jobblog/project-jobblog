The same top <mark>safe</mark> workplace concerns have been identified in previous surveys—lack of employee involvement, employees taking shortcuts or ignoring rules, and supervisor participation in safety programs.

It doesn&#8217;t take much effort to discern the connection between these difficulties. Supervisors won&#8217;t anticipate employee participation if they aren&#8217;t involved in safety measures, and workers will get the (largely unspoken) message that rules can be disobeyed.

The not-so-simple truth is that workplace safety must be a top-down priority with 100% buy-in from leadership, managers, and supervisors, or it will be pushed aside by the “just get it done” production mindset that often comes with tight deadlines.

Leaders have the authority to enforce compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and promote workplace safety. With the following ways to safety awareness, you can protect your workers and your bottom line.



### **Make Expectations Clearly and Consistently**

Employees must be aware of their performance standards in order to fulfill and surpass them. The same is true when it comes to safety expectations. Set safe goals for the workplace and make safety measures transparent.


### **Safety Procedures in Practice**

Safety precautions are rarely one-size-fits-all solutions that work in all situations. Building construction workers, for example, might be required to wear work gloves, yet gloves might obstruct someone doing intricate finish work. The greatest approach to ensure that regulations are followed is to have workers participate in their creation. When employees feel empowered to express their concerns about a particular strategy, safety becomes more effective.

### **Safety Training Reinforcement**

Employee safety training cannot be completed in a single session, and it is rarely practical to take personnel off the job to attend a refresher course. In the drive to finish the task, it&#8217;s easy to ignore safety precautions, therefore they must be reiterated on a frequent basis to stay top of mind.

Before the start of the workday, some supervisors gather their employees for a quick safety meeting and ask, &#8220;Where are we likely to have safety exposures today?&#8221; What will be required of us in order to overcome them?” Another, more informal way is to offer real-time praise for positive safety practices and remedial comments when safety protocols are not followed.

Additionally, some businesses find that investing in safety training software or applications with videos that employees can watch on-demand is advantageous. At the end of the video, employees take a short quiz to check that they comprehend the information. This can be a time-saving method of providing and documenting continuing training.



### **Self-Inspection on a Regular Basis**

Conduct safety walkaround inspections on a regular basis to search for any potential dangers. By definition, a clean workplace is a safe job site. It&#8217;s a lot easier to avoid tripping hazards and debris when tools are put away and pathways are cleared.



### **Leadership that Prioritizes Safety**

If safety isn&#8217;t a top issue for you, it won&#8217;t be for anyone else. This means that everyone in your company&#8217;s leadership or management positions must walk the walk and talk the talk when it comes to your safety program. Demonstrate your commitment to a safe workplace by investing appropriately in safety technology, equipment, and training, as well as continuously modeling safe behavior on the job.


### **Are you looking for additional strategies to increase work safety?**

Have you thought about incorporating technology into your safety program? Safety apps and management software are routinely launched to the market, and the technology is a benefit for businesses looking for new ways to improve workplace safety and track their progress.
