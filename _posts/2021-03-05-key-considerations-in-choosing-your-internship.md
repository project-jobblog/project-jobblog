Are you a student about to graduate or someone looking for job experience? An internship can be a great learning opportunity that allows you to develop new skills and advance professionally. The only problem is that you do not know what exactly you want to do for a living.

So, how do you choose the best internship for you?

Your primary focus should be to demonstrate applicable job experience. Those with internships on their resumes have a better chance of landing a position and earning a higher salary. This is because an internship will serve as a springboard for gaining experience, marketing those experiences, and using those experiences to [find the right job.](/tips-you-need-to-find-your-dream-job-and-get-hired-faster/)

**Here are some things to think about while looking for an internship**

### **Choose an internship that will allow you to develop important skills**

When it comes to advancing your career, there are a few key skills that you should have. Some of the more complex skills are leadership, teamwork, project management, and relationship building. When researching internships, look at the types of skills you&#8217;ll gain during the internship.

Having a list of skills you want to improve will help you to determine if those skills can be enhanced when serving as an intern during the application and interview process. During the interview, inquire about the internship mentoring program, preparation and resources, tasks and assignments, and feedback performance requirements. Strong internship programs will help you achieve both of these goals.

### **Being a self-starter is a great way to start in a company**

Finding the right internship is somewhat similar to looking for a career. It&#8217;s helpful to have an idea of what you would like to do in the future, and then make a bucket list of companies where you&#8217;d like to intern.

Perhaps the organization where you want to intern does not allow or advertise interns on a regular basis. A cover letter expressing your strong interest in interning for the organization or volunteering 5-20 hours per week will go a long way. Show initiative, passion, commitment, and a desire to succeed to the potential employer.

This is also a good networking technique because, even if you don&#8217;t get a job right away, you begin to build relationships with people at these businesses, and they will remember you when a job opportunity arises.

### **Don&#8217;t Make a Decision Based on Money**

An unpaid internship will pay off greatly in the long run, not to mention contribute to a lucrative [job offer](/things-to-consider-before-accepting-a-job-offer/). Concentrate your internship search on companies that are looking to develop and expand, as they will want to hire you after graduation to help them get to the next level.

Overall, finding the right internship for you will lead to a full-time commitment and progression with introductory training and experience.
