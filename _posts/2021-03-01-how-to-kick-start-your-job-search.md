Its time for new beginnings, for improving yourself and tackling a goal you&#8217;ve been meaning to achieve for a while. But, if you don&#8217;t want to spend your New Year&#8217;s resolution on weight loss or exercise regimes that you&#8217;ll most likely abandon by the end of the month, why not concentrate on anything that will stay with you during the month?

It&#8217;s a perfect time to start searching for a new career at the start of the year. Companies may have obtained their annual budgets and will have a fixed sum set aside for new hires. After their break, recruiters will be re energized and ready to find a good candidate like you.

So, if you want a new career or advance your career in general, you can make it a top priority. And, to keep you on track, we&#8217;ve put together a list of helpful hints to help you get started on your job search!

### **Make a list of possible job openings**

Instead of applying to something you think you&#8217;d be successful at, you should have a plan in place before starting your job saearch. Six months down the track, this is likely to result in a work quest that remains stagnant.

Create a list of [dream jobs](/tips-you-need-to-find-your-dream-job-and-get-hired-faster/) you&#8217;d like to do instead. Consider this a fresh start, a chance to follow a career you&#8217;ve always wanted to do. Bear in mind that the consistency of the applications is much more critical than the quantity. You should spend more time searching for what you want to do rather than what you should do.

### **Update You Resume**

Until you start looking for jobs, you should update your CV so that you have a master template that you can alter at any time. If you&#8217;re searching for work or not, it&#8217;s a good idea to update your CV or résumé every 6 to 12 months (at the very least) to reflect your most recent skills and achievements. It&#8217;s also vital to customize your CV to the role you&#8217;re applying for, with specific keywords scattered throughout.

But don&#8217;t follow the generic route; you could mention you&#8217;re a well-organized and multi-tasking employee, but hiring managers are inundated with these phrases and aren&#8217;t pleased by clear keywords.

### **Define Your Core Skills**

Examine the qualifications and core skills rather than the job titles. When you search hard enough, you&#8217;ll be shocked to find appropriate roles with different titles. You&#8217;ll be more focused on your strengths and talents if you recognize your skills, and you&#8217;ll be able to find more beneficial roles that will help your ability to perform well. You can extend your quest and target various positions this way.

### **Contact with the Companies You Want to Work For**

Now that you&#8217;ve decided what kind of work you want to do, it&#8217;s time to start approaching your dream employers, even if they aren&#8217;t currently recruiting. There&#8217;s no point in sending them a friendly email expressing your willingness to work with them and listing the reasons you feel you&#8217;d be a good fit and why you&#8217;d like to work there in the first place. This not only demonstrates your initiative, but it also demonstrates your loyalty to the business.

### **Keep In Touch with Recruiters**

While you shouldn&#8217;t rely solely on recruiters or headhunters, they can help you find opportunities that aren&#8217;t listed on the internet. Recruiters are great because they can help you sell your skills to hiring managers and can also help you obtain a better wage than you might on your own (mainly to increase their commission). If you work in a sector where there is a talent shortage, you&#8217;ll be a great fit for a recruiter&#8217;s dream list – they&#8217;ll be able to sell your talents and match you to the job that you&#8217;re looking for. If you work in a job with a wide pool of applicants, however, a recruiting agent can find it more difficult to assist you.

### **Make an investment in your personal growth**

You should invest in your growth by advancing and developing your skills to keep the momentum going. There are a number of ways to do this, including short courses, side gigs, and personal studies.

There&#8217;s always space for growth, so keep up with industry trends and demonstrate that you&#8217;re a step above the competition. Meanwhile, if you&#8217;re trying to break into another sector, you might volunteer at a similar institution on the weekends to demonstrate that you have relevant experience.

### **Make Connections!**

Hide behind a computer screen can only get you so far; start networking if you really want to tap into new opportunities. Attend business meetings, alumni mixers, and casual interviews to reconnect with old relationships and make new ones. Start talking to people who work in the fields you&#8217;re interested in. It&#8217;s a perfect way to see if their company has any openings or if they know someone who might refer you. Employee referrals have the highest applicant-to-hire conversion rate – only 7% of applicants apply, but they account for 40% of all hires.

### **Make appropriate improvements to your social media profiles**

A [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile that is up to date is much more impressive than a regular two-page CV because it allows you to communicate with industry experts at the click of a button and have a private conversation with them. You will easily become a well-known figure in your field by engaging with companies and sharing industry news. However, you must use the right keywords to help people find you on LinkedIn; for example, if you&#8217;re a digital marketer, include your skills in your job description.

### **Ace in the Interview**

Your interview is the next significant stumbling block in your job search. You&#8217;ve probably already impressed the hiring manager with your impressive CV; now all you have to do is prove that you&#8217;re a good cultural match and that you have the skills you claim to have! This is why it is important to [prepare for an interview](/category/job-interview-tip/). Spend time learning about the brand, planning answers to frequently asked questions, and choosing an appropriate outfit and hairstyle. The hiring manager is looking for the whole package, so make sure you deliver. And, after your interview, don&#8217;t forget to give a [thank-you note](/thank-you-note-after-a-job-interview/)!

### **A Better Job Offer**

If you&#8217;ve made it through all of the interview rounds, you&#8217;ll almost definitely be [offered a job](/things-to-consider-before-accepting-a-job-offer/), but don&#8217;t take anything without first considering what else is available. You don&#8217;t want the same thing to happen again if the pay was the reason you quit your former job. Try negotiating a raise or, at the very least, demanding a review after you&#8217;ve finished your probation (if the salary is non-negotiable). However, don&#8217;t forget to factor in any bonuses, special deals, or other benefits that the organization can provide.

Nothing is stopping you from progressing in your career, particularly with these tips! Your spirits are high, your motivation is blooming, and nothing is stopping you from advancing in your career.
