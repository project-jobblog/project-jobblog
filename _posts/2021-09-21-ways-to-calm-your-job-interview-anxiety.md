Do you have any job interview anxiety yet?. You&#8217;re going to have a big job interview soon. This may be the case! It&#8217;s your one and only chance to land the perfect job. Do you get nervous just thinking about a job interview? Do you have concerns that your nerves would prevent you from impressing your interviewer?

If that&#8217;s the case, you&#8217;re not alone. According to a recent poll, 73% of job seekers said that searching for a new job is one of the most difficult aspects of their lives. It&#8217;s normal to feel anxious. A job interview is unlike any other situation you&#8217;ve ever seen.

Few other circumstances require you to be in the hot seat and offer such an unusual account of yourself. Nerves are understandably high before an interview, particularly if it&#8217;s for a position you really want and the stakes are high.

Pre-interview anxiety, unfortunately, can really hurt your results on the big day. Nervousness can cause severe interview errors such as blanking out, blurting, babbling, sweating, and fidgeting.

### **Always Be Prepared**

Preparation leads to trust, and confidence puts you in charge — and can even make you look forward to the interview if you do your homework seriously. Your nervous energy can also be channeled into a constructive force if you have confidence.

It&#8217;s similar to how an athlete prepares for a big game by training to be in optimal shape on game day. The more you plan and practice, the more secure you&#8217;ll be in the job interview where your career goals are on the line. This self-assurance will help you get rid of unattractive nervous behaviors (such as saying um, uh, and like) and feel more in control of your response and body language.

So let&#8217;s talk about how to plan in a way that empowers you and reduces your anxiety before the interview.

### **Don&#8217;t Give In to desperation**

No matter how much you want the job, it&#8217;s just a one-time chance. The fact that you get this job does not mean your whole future is in jeopardy. You don&#8217;t even have a good understanding of the job. Sure, it appears to be a good idea on paper, but it isn&#8217;t your only choice.

From the perspective of the interviewer, enthusiasm is fine, but neediness can be uncomfortable. Consider it like a first date. You want to [make a good impression](/tips-to-make-a-great-first-impression-on-your-first-day-of-work/) and demonstrate the best qualities. You don&#8217;t want to come off as a possible bunny boiler who has yet to be asked out.

Whatever happens, this interview will serve as a learning opportunity that will help you become a stronger job applicant and a more knowledgeable professional in the long run.

Concentrate on exuding confidence and putting all of your previous preparation to good use. You have no say over how the employer makes a decision, but you do have control over how you portray yourself during the interview.

Keep in mind that you are there because your resume or the impact you made during the screening interview impressed them. That&#8217;s a compelling reason to be optimistic on the day of the interview.

### **Emphasize the Positive**

When it comes to job interviews, it helps to be optimistic. Even the best applicants face frequent rejection and rude actions during the job search, so it&#8217;s easy to become cynical.

Although cynicism and bitterness can be amusing at a party, they can be detrimental in a job interview. Nobody wants to recruit someone who has a bad attitude.

Negativity, on the other hand, will keep you from seeing and communicating your main selling points clearly in your interview. Prepare and train with the mindset that you will ace this interview.

Declare yourself ready once you&#8217;ve completed your preparations. Listen to inspirational music that energizes you and makes you feel good about yourself and the world. Some people prefer guided meditations or motivational speeches, and you can even record your own motivational speech.

When you arrive at the job interview location, remember to turn off the music and other happy sounds. Wearing headphones during the interview, even if just in the lobby will make you seem disoriented.

New surroundings will add to the anxiety, which is why most career experts advise paying at least one visit to any unfamiliar interview venue ahead of time.

Otherwise, you face the worst-case scenario: getting lost or caught in traffic and being late, sweaty, and flustered at your interview. Allow yourself some extra time. If you&#8217;re running late, you can always freshen up and rehydrate.

### **Techniques for Relaxation and Confidence Boosting**

Some people find that anti-anxiety strategies, such as breathing exercises and mental imagery, are effective.

**Here are a few that have proven to be effective for nervous candidates:**

* **Visualization** — Visualizing a successful interview can help you relax. Imagine yourself in the interview room, making a great first impression, and feel the deep sense of positive trust that you will experience. When you pair the picture with a strong positive feeling and associate the two, you&#8217;ll get the best performance. It&#8217;s a quick and simple way to concentrate your thoughts and boost your self-assurance.
* **Power Posture** — Did you know that a simple two-minute body language trick will boost your morale and help you perform better in interviews? Before your interview, “power posing” entails posing like a superhero for two minutes. Simply stand stall and solid with hands on hips and legs confidently apart, as if you were &#8220;Superman.&#8221;

  * It can seem ridiculous, but it works. Power posing resulted in substantial increases in testosterone and significant decreases in [cortisol](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037). This method alters the composition of the body.
  * A follow-up study focused on work interviews explicitly. The interviewers overwhelmingly selected the &#8220;high-power&#8221; posers as recruiting content.
  * Right now, give it a shot and see for yourself. Only remember to practice posing in front of the mirror before the interview.
* **Redirecting Inquiries** — You won&#8217;t know the answer to every question, and the job interviewer will purposefully leave you guessing. Some interviewers ask you stress questions solely to see how you react.

  * The best way to handle these tough questions is to gracefully redirect them to a related subject you&#8217;re familiar with, ideally while emphasizing your strengths. Maintain a cool and composed demeanor at all times. Allowing one difficult question to alter the mood of the interview is not a good idea. Concentrate on answering the next questions thoroughly and concluding the meeting on a positive note.
* **Taking a breath** — Box breathing is a quick and efficient breathing exercise that is often referred to as &#8220;box breathing.&#8221; It takes only a few seconds to complete, no matter where you are, and it works wonders for reducing anxiety.

**How to Box-Breathe:**

Box breathing can be accomplished in easy steps:

* Slowly inhale for 4 seconds, then hold your breath for 4 seconds at the end of the inhale.
* Exhale for 4 seconds, then hold your breath for 4 seconds at the end of the exhale and repeat.

After completing the cycle only once, you can feel immediately calmer, but repeat it as many times as possible to feel the anxiety dissipate.

* **Maintaining a Pace** — It&#8217;s possible that your anxiety has taken over and you&#8217;re speaking too quickly if you&#8217;re stumbling over your thoughts. When you&#8217;re nervous, your mannerisms and voice seem to pick up. It can also make you talk before you have fully considered the issue.

  * Don&#8217;t rush and don&#8217;t be afraid to take a breath. You&#8217;re more likely to say something you&#8217;ll regret if you rush to fill any silence. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed to take a break. Before answering difficult questions, interviewers expect you to take a breath and consider.
  * If your pause becomes uncomfortable, say something like, “That&#8217;s a great question.” I just need a few minutes to think about the best example to give.”
  * We guarantee that if you follow our advice and put in the necessary preparation time, your nerves will not sabotage you during your window of opportunity. Feel the anxiety and still ace the interview!
