You need to make sure your resume is optimized and ready to be sent out to employers before you begin the job application process. The fight is not so much having enough stuff to be used on your resume. Instead, to improve the chances of securing an interview, it is choosing what skills, experiences, and achievements to put on your resume.

It is easier said than done to choose the correct skills to put on your resume. What qualities can recruiters and hiring managers really stand out for? What qualifications indicate why you will be a great choice for the position? What qualifications are better reflected by what you bring to the table?

Luckily, you can follow a simple method to ensure that you answer these questions and set yourself up for job opportunities.

### **Decode the Job Description**

It&#8217;s important to read through the job description and understand what the job actually involves before you even click &#8220;apply&#8221; on a job posting.

What is this business really looking for in an applicant? Which duties are listed? What skills do they ask for?

You need to evaluate the job description, then think about how you&#8217;d fit into an employee&#8217;s &#8220;mold&#8221; that they have in mind for the position. Think about the key roles you have had in your previous employment.

Do your previous core duties translate into skills that are needed by this job posting, skills that would make you a perfect fit for the position?

### **Can I quantify that?**

When you have decoded the job description and decided whether you have the skills that the employer asks for, it is time to think about what skills you can put on your resume, because you can not include all of them.

By having only hard skills on your resume is the trick to getting your resume past the ATS systems.

What ATS processes and hiring managers want to see are hard skills (skills that link directly to core responsibilities). It is probably a soft skills if you can&#8217;t measure it. **Soft skills** DO NOT belong to your CV.

So, ask yourself, &#8220;Can I quantify that?&#8221; while determining what skills you can include in your resume. It&#8217;s a hard skill, if you can, and it&#8217;s on your resume.

On your resume, both industry-specific and transferable hard skills will go. You will know which hard skills the employer is looking for after decoding the job description.

### **Think of the brand you have**

Branding deals with the next step in determining which skills can go on your resume. You want to make sure that for job openings you are &#8220;branding&#8221; yourself correctly.

By that, we mean understanding what kind of service you provide in a company, and what skills help that service.

After all, we know every job seeker here at Ph Careers is a company-of-one. In order to draw buyers (employers looking to invest in you), are you branding your company (yourself) correctly?

### **Customize Your Resume**

Customization is the last step in determining which skills can go on your resume.

It&#8217;s really important to customize your resume. For the numerous jobs you are applying for, you will possibly have to emphasize different skills. For each job application, that means customizing your resume.

Which projects have you worked on? What skills have you acquired? What ability do you emphasize?

For each job you apply for, if you ask yourself these questions, the answers will most likely be different. That&#8217;s how you&#8217;re going to know that you&#8217;re correctly customizing your resume, and offering yourself the best opportunity to secure a [job interview](/category/job-interviews/).

Know that you have more skills than you understand, when you think about your resume. Your task is to make it easy for employers to see the connection between your skill sets and the required skill sets to do the job.

In the job search process, the aim at this point is to get an interview. Only when you know you are in the running should you think about getting the job.
