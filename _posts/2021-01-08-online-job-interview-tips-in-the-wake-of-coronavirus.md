Coronavirus (COVID-19) may have slowed things around the world, but this has not stopped enterprises from finding new employees.

Companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon PageGroup, and LinkedIn have announced they will migrate to online job interviews for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, according to news [reports](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166528/linkedin-coronavirus-job-interviews-virtual-bluejeans-travel-limit).

Although not recent, online job interviews are a good step to keep things going while avoiding the COVID-19 threat. Recruiters are reported to find it easy to reach potential candidates because most of them [work from home](/category/work-from-home/) and are free from meetings and travel.

Are you ready to nail one, as more and more businesses switch to online job interviews? Although online job interviews are not that different from conventional interviews, there are a few factors you should take into account in order to increase your chances of success in an interview.

Here we mention a few tips in the wake of COVID-19 to help you prepare for online job interviews.

Ask a few questions first, to help you understand the format of your interview clearly.

  * Is there anyone who asks you questions, or are there pre-recorded questions?
  * How many chances do you get to record your response, if pre-recorded?
  * Is it an interview via telephone?
  * Is it an interview via video call?
  * What software/online service am I going to use?
  * What if I face a technical challenge? What do I do? Who should I reach out to?

Once the structure of your online job interview is clear to you, make a note of the following:

**Test your tech:** Make sure the equipment and technology you are using is in good condition before the interview. Test your internet connectivity, audio-video quality, the program you can use for Zoom, Skype, WeChat Work, etc. if it is a video interview.

**Dress well:** While you don&#8217;t (physically) meet your interviewer in person, it&#8217;s best to dress well for the occasion. And yes, don&#8217;t forget to smile at yourself! This helps.

**Be prepared:** When you are well prepared, it is always beneficial. Just as you would have in a typical interview, make sure that you have done your homework. Understand the position about which you are being interviewed and keep questions handy about follow-up.

**Pick a good spot:** Make sure your spot is well-lit and not noisy for your interview. If possible, stay away from overhead lighting during the interview, safer if you&#8217;re near a window. To prevent the last-minute headache, it&#8217;s nice if you determine your interview place a day before the interview.

**Job Industries for work from home:**

  * Consulting Jobs
  * Web Design Jobs 
  * Social Media Jobs 
  * Online Tutor Jobs 

**Body language:** Sit straight, smile, and make contact with your eyes. Small tips in a video interview, but as successful as they are in a face-to-face interview.

And yes, the best part of an online job interview, considering the moment we&#8217;re in, is that you don&#8217;t have to think about the handshake.

A positive attitude always helps, no matter what position and organization you are being interviewed for. So, smile and it&#8217;ll all fall into place.
