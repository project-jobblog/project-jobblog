We should all know by now that lying on a resume is risky. But, guess what? In the job search conversation between employers and applicants, a little deceit on the employer&#8217;s part is not unusual.

Frequently, there is no malice intended. If there are a few poor apples in the bunch (as there are in the rest of humanity), most recruiters and HR professionals are guided by a willingness to place the best candidates in the positions they have to fill. The issue is that overwork and broad applicant pools can sabotage good intentions, so those little white lies intended to protect a job seeker&#8217;s feelings end up doing more harm than good.

These are the common lies told by recruiters so you can spot them and be prepared to deal with them.

### **Salary is calculated or depends on experience**

Typically, the company has a rough estimate in mind. When a recruiter inquires about your pay criteria or aspirations, he&#8217;s looking to see if you&#8217;re in the same ballpark.

**How to deal with it:**

In general, it&#8217;s best to wait until you&#8217;ve received a job offer before discussing compensation, but recruiters do often use salary criteria to narrow down the applicant pool.

In this scenario, having done comprehensive research is your strongest defense. Make sure you understand what is competitive for the job, market, and area, as well as what is suitable for someone with your experience. That way, you can respond to the question in terms of what your research has shown (rather than your personal needs), and then add something like, “But of course, a compensation discussion makes more sense when we&#8217;re considering a **job offer**.”

</blockquote>

Don&#8217;t undersell yourself, just let the recruiter know that you&#8217;ll balance non-salary benefits (like sick days and other perks) against the actual salary bid.

### **We&#8217;ll remember you for potential opportunities**

Recruiters communicate with a wide number of individuals. And the majority of them have sizable candidate pools. When they say anything untrue, they usually mean it: they&#8217;ll keep your resume on tape. Only remember that they&#8217;re doing it in a massive filing cabinet, and that out of sight, out of mind is always the case.

**How to deal with it:**

Don&#8217;t take &#8220;**no**&#8221; to mean &#8220;**never**.&#8221; If you&#8217;ve begun a discussion with a recruiter, don&#8217;t let it stop just because you haven&#8217;t been given a job. Maintain contact via professional networking sites and keep up with company news so you&#8217;re aware of openings before they&#8217;re advertised.

Only keep in mind that the line between &#8220;**staying in touch**&#8221; and &#8220;**stalking**&#8221; is thin. So just contact the recruiter if you have a valid purpose. And, as with all professional connections, don&#8217;t just ask for favors; look for opportunities to help.

### **We haven&#8217;t done our interviews yet**

This is often real. This could indicate that you&#8217;re the company&#8217;s &#8220;Plan B&#8221; nominee. However, this comment makes it sound as if the organization has narrowed down a viable group of candidates, which isn&#8217;t always the case. This line is often used as a stalling strategy by recruiters who are always searching for someone more perfect than someone in their current applicant pool.

**How to deal with it:**

Take this assertion as an opportunity to show your worth. Ask questions like, &#8220;Do you have any particular questions or concerns about my ability to manage any part of the job?&#8221; if the post-interview wait time is being extended because the recruiting committee is &#8220;reviewing other applicants.&#8221; I&#8217;d love to speak with them and show them why I&#8217;m the best candidate.”

Any conversation you have with a recruiter or hiring manager is an opportunity to convince them that you are the [best candidate for the job](/how-to-figure-out-if-you-are-right-for-the-job/). Asking straightforward questions and being concentrated will help you figure out what&#8217;s really going on if you&#8217;re getting mixed signals.

### **Either way, you&#8217;ll hear from us**

The fact is that you can never hear — or may not hear when you least expect it. The reasons vary, but a lack of contact following an interview can suggest the hiring team&#8217;s indecisiveness.

**How to deal with it:**

Take control of this lie the right away. Always know what you should expect to hear from the hiring managers when you leave a **job interview**. That way, you won&#8217;t be tormented by the possibility of calling them back too soon. Send a polite email to check in if they say they&#8217;ll get back to you by next Friday but don&#8217;t.

This check-in email can also be used to continue selling yourself as a candidate. If you have any additional thoughts on the subjects discussed in the interview, now is a good time to share them. Give them more time if they need it, but be firm and polite when it comes to following up.

If a company never calls you after an interview, even to say &#8220;no thank you,&#8221; it might mean that something is wrong with the company. Employers who are smart realize that treating candidates as clients is the best way to do business.

### **The reality about job searching**

There are several facets of the job search that are perplexing. What should the length of my resume be? Do they want to contact me again this year? Is it appropriate for me to wear a tie to the interview? Is it appropriate to bargain for more holiday time? And that&#8217;s just the job search; once you get the job, you&#8217;ll face a whole new set of challenges.
