How to Overcome Burnout and Stay Motivated as a Recruiter? [Workplace burnout](/how-to-overcome-workplace-burnout/) is no laughing matter. Demotivation, anxiety/stress, and feeling overwhelmed are all symptoms of excessive weariness. Burnout rates have risen significantly since the start of the pandemic, which is unsurprising. In fact, in 2020, Google searches for the phrase &#8220;signs of burnout&#8221; increased by [150 percent](https://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/diversity-and-equality-inclusion/uk-heading-towards-burnout-breakpoint/) over prior years, indicating that many employees felt more pressure to perform in order to help their organizations navigate through the epidemic.

Working in recruitment, like many other businesses, has presented challenges during the last 12 months. Numerous recruiters found it difficult to contact clients at the start of the epidemic because they had switched from offices to home offices and put many roles on hold overnight. Candidates also felt discouraged during job searching or stuck in their existing positions since they didn&#8217;t want to risk [shifting to a new position](/how-to-changing-career-without-losing-your-mind-or-yourself/) because of the economic crisis.

As the market in many industries recovers and new jobs are sought by agencies, many consultants may face a tough transition in order to stay up with demand. You are not alone if you find yourself in this situation. We&#8217;ve highlighted four crucial steps you can take in the coming months to protect your mental energy and overcome burnout.

### **Recognize your own personal signals**

It&#8217;s very essential to be kind to ourselves, and allow ourselves to just have those moments. Part of this entails becoming more aware of your own particular signals that things aren&#8217;t quite right. Maybe you&#8217;re not sleeping well, or you&#8217;re skipping your regular walk, which you typically like. If you think you&#8217;re on the verge of becoming burnt out, tell your friends and family what to look for so they can spot it before you do.

### **Draw a line around your boundaries**

Over-communication is critical when teams continue to work remotely or partially remotely. This is also true when it comes to defining your personal boundaries. At the very least, let your coworkers know when you&#8217;ll be done for the day and when you&#8217;ll be taking a break for lunch. If you need to take a few hours off to finish paperwork or work with minimum distractions, schedule it in your calendar and treat it as if it were a client meeting. These healthy habits will teach your staff the significance of separating work and personal time, which will help them avoid overworking.

### **Create a support system**

Having at least one person you can dump your ideas and feelings to, whether it&#8217;s your desk buddy or your best friend, is critical when dealing with stressful situations. It&#8217;s critical to schedule regular check-ins with your support network to see how you&#8217;re doing. It might be as easy as a five-minute catch-up at the end of the week or a monthly cocktail party.

Whoever you choose, you must give them the authority to intervene if they observe you engaging in negative behaviors. In this manner, they can serve as a sounding board for various coping tactics and help you get through even the most severe burnout episodes.

### **Get up and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not OK.&#8221;**

Keep in mind that you can only handle so much. We&#8217;re all still dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic, so it&#8217;s understandable if you&#8217;re feeling unmotivated or overwhelmed. If you fear you&#8217;re on the verge of burning out, however, you should talk to your boss. You can regain control of your to-do list by contacting them and requesting them to re-prioritize your workload. Taking a step back and recognizing where you require assistance is critical in these instances.



As recruiters, we are frequently put under great duress. When generating shortlists for multiple clients at once, we may have to spend long hours or feel agitated. When you&#8217;re feeling burned out, though, you need to act immediately to avoid being unwell or unable to operate. You should be able to overcome burnout and promote healthy ways to manage your mental health and wellness by taking efforts to prevent the cause.
