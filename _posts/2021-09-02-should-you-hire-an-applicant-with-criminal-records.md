It&#8217;s critical to choose people who are hardworking, loyal, and trustworthy when recruiting and hiring for your company. You want to hire people who will represent your company well &#8211; this is a goal that many managers and business owners strive for. Unfortunately, people with criminal backgrounds are frequently eliminated from the application pool as a result of this. Almost a third of the working-age population has been convicted of a crime. By denying a fair chance to applicants with a criminal past, you are excluding a substantial number of competent candidates who may be a valuable addition to your team.

Hiring managers are missing out on hardworking, much-needed talent by failing to check into the applications of individuals with CORIs. This might result in fewer hours of operation and a loss of profit, which is something that businesses cannot afford. In this blog, we&#8217;ll look at the benefits of hiring someone with a criminal past.

### **Tax Credit for People with Disabilities**

Aside from hiring an employee with exceptional skills and a desire to learn, your business may be eligible for a tax benefit. This will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the IRS. You may be eligible for this reward if you give a second opportunity to an employee who suffers particular obstacles as a result of the crime they committed. As a result, your company will get new talent as well as cash rewards. What a win-win situation! Learn more: [Why do Hard Skills Matter?](/why-do-hard-skills-matter/) 

Visit the IRS [website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/work-opportunity-tax-credit) to learn more and study the specific laws that may apply to your recruiting procedure.

### **You Might Be Surprised by a Second Chance**

If a convicted criminal submits a job application in the hopes of being hired, it demonstrates that they are ready to completely embrace a second chance at life. After being convicted of a crime, getting a job is frequently the first step in re-entering society. Potential employees will be unable to pay rent, buy groceries, or live a regular life if they do not have a job. You are giving someone a second chance by interviewing people with criminal records. You can expect them to work hard and be loyal to your company in return.

### **Criminal Records Aren&#8217;t a Good Indicator of Ability**

Just because someone has a criminal record doesn&#8217;t indicate they aren&#8217;t capable, talented, or committed. You&#8217;re missing out on loyal prospects who can assist you operate your business if you disqualify personnel with a criminal past. Remember that these people had a life before they were convicted. This means they&#8217;ve presumably worked in a range of industries at other locations. As a result, they will be able to come in and fulfill their obligations while also teaching others the skills they have mastered previously.

Rather than emphasizing criminal history, highlight expertise, prior experience, personality, availability, and dedication. Concentrate your interviews on what each applicant can bring to the table right now, regardless of their previous experience. This is true for all candidates!

### **If you discriminate against applicants with a criminal record, you could face legal consequences**

Have you heard of “ban the box” legislation? These policies assist applicants to avoid discrimination and bias. The majority of applicants are navigating their re-entry into society and the workforce on their own, as assistance can be difficult to come by. The laws that your company must obey are determined by the state in which it operates. As a result, it&#8217;s critical to conduct your own research. Employers will, in most situations, undertake background checks.

During the first phases of the recruiting process, however, they are not permitted to inquire about a candidate&#8217;s criminal history. You&#8217;re putting your company at risk if you don&#8217;t follow these rules.

### **Make A Job Offer**

When it comes to gaining a second chance at life, applicants with a criminal past don&#8217;t necessarily get much help. Welcoming them onto your team can not only provide them with an opportunity to support themselves, but it can also enhance their confidence. Employment can provide a person with a sense of purpose and growth opportunities.

We hope that the next time you start your hiring process, you think about the benefits of hiring someone with a criminal record! Best of luck in assembling your ideal team.
