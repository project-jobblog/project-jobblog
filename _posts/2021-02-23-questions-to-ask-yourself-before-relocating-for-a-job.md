Here are some things to remember and key relocating for a job questions before emailing your resume to some far-off employer:

### **_Is there employment in my industry in the area where I am willing to relocate?_**

The Bureau of Labor Statistics makes it possible to locate U. S. A snapshot of regional economic data. Your employment prospects will depend on your ability to adapt to developing or affiliated sectors or to improve your skillset if the job market in your new city is different from your current city. Would you like data on local living costs and home values? Along with demographics, educational levels, economy, unemployment rates, property tax, and other economic outlook data, [City Data](http://www.city-data.com/) assess these items.

Anyone who has pounded the pavement will tell you that a job search in and of itself is a job, but past studies can make it infinitely easier to relocate.

### **_What&#8217;s my tolerance to risk?_**

In exploring the boundaries of their comfort zones, optimistic, innovative and entrepreneurial individuals are used. Freelance projects and unrealistic lifestyles, particularly when job security has shaped your career, are not for everyone. You may have enjoyed your place at your previous company, but because of a partner&#8217;s work transition, moving for a job is justified, or you need to move to be closer to friends and family. It is stressful to change jobs, but changing to a new place adds unfamiliarity to the mix.

Ask yourself whether you are thrown off-kilter by minor changes, or if trying something different energizes you. When you know your threshold for danger beforehand, your leap of faith will be smoother.

### **Am I able to spend less money and more time for a better quality of life?**

A local job quest is sufficiently demanding. This problem is exacerbated by moving for a job because you need to discern whether your new salary would cover basic expenses and cost of living disparities, and let&#8217;s not forget about the cost of relocation. To plan, you will want to start shoring up your finances and make fiscal changes such as reducing non-essentials. Compare the cost of living in your current area and the standard of life in your new one. A salary calculator can be instrumental in deciding how much to keep afloat you would need to earn.

### **I need to relocate. Is a career transition at the same time feasible?**

In the last decade, the economy has changed in important ways. Consider the outlook and how many working years you have ahead of you in your business. No matter what area you&#8217;re in, taking up a new skill will make you more marketable and improve your confidence. While some go back to gain a degree, many use online courses or certifications to build skills. Your planning and analysis will provide a solid basis for taking the next step or practicing caution before doing so, much as when [preparing for a job interview](/what-to-expect-in-a-final-job-interview/).

### **Am I supposed to abandon my job and just move?**

Maybe dumping the corporate rat race and setting out sounds like a dream on your own. Before starting a potential new life in an unfamiliar city, dig deeper.

  * How long is your new commute going to take?
  * Find out what the locals are doing for fun: are they outdoors, lovers of culture?
  * Is renting or buying more cost effective?
  * What is the living standard?
  * In your free time, what are you going to do?

### **Do I have the employer&#8217;s perspective in mind?**

Convenience and expense are two major reasons why an out-of-area candidate won&#8217;t take a second look at hiring managers. Allay their worries by specifying in your cover letter that preparations for a relocating for a job are already underway and that you are available to interview at the convenience of the employer. You might be able to list a local address inside the contact information portion of your resume by reconnecting with a friend or relative with whom you can stay short-term or find temporary housing.

Be sure to mention upfront that you do not expect prospective employers to collect your relocation-related expenses. Fortunately, certain costs for job hunting can be tax-deductible. Before you send out the first inquiry letter, keep the employer&#8217;s viewpoint in mind.

Pace yourself when thinking about relocating for a job. No one is fully inured to the risks inherent in jumping into the unknown, but when you land, you will soften the blow with plenty of planning.
