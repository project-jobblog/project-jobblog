Safe Workplace Culture Tip: Supporting employees in both a professional and personal sense has become part of an employer&#8217;s job in the wake of a difficult year. Employees who are happy work harder. According to Survey, firms that provide a high level of assistance to their employees have a 21 percent rise in high achievers. Employees&#8217; emotional and physical health improves when they are supported by their broader life experience.

COVID-19 increased distance work while also exposing limitations in face-to-face communication and collaborative work. As hybrid and flexible working become more common, the office may become a business&#8217;s anchor. Safe workplace culture can provide several chances for training, skill development, and social interaction, as well as construct a company&#8217;s external perception among customers, stakeholders, and potential employees. Workplace health, safety, and well-being are the way of the future!

### **Workplace Health and Safety Checklist**

If you aren&#8217;t bound by a contract and are looking for new office space, health and safety should be taken into account.

Is it possible to find a workspace that has already been set up with health and safety features, such as a serviced office in a [coworking space](/the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-coworking-spaces/)? Could you hire a workspace provider who understands how to create a safe working environment? It&#8217;s a good idea to do your homework and get advice from professionals!

There are procedures you&#8217;ll need to do to return to the office securely if you already have office space from before the pandemic. A work-related health and safety checklist is provided below:

 
**Complete a risk assessment:** Before reopening your existing office to your employees, conduct a risk assessment.

**Wash your hands:** Make sure your employees have lots of opportunities to do so, as well as reminders. For high-touchpoint regions, you might also wish to supply hand sanitizer and wipes.

**Improve ventilation:** Open doors and windows and use air conditioning to keep workspaces well ventilated.

**Keep employees informed:** Processes are only effective when they&#8217;re used on a regular basis, so evaluate changes with your staff and set expectations, and make sure they feel safe and happy at work.

**Make employee well-being a priority:** Schedule 1:1 or group check-in sessions to check in with employees and tweak processes as needed to ensure they feel safe and happy.

**Keep your distance:** Keeping a distance of 1-2 meters between you and your staff will make them feel more at ease. Instead of working face to face, try using tape to mark out distances, putting up signs to remind personnel, and working side by side.

**Use your space effectively:** Make effective use of your space by using one-way systems and arranging workplace sections by the department to limit people&#8217;s movement. To allow employees to stagger their use of office spaces, keep track of who will be utilizing them when on a team calendar.

**Increase your cleaning protocols:** Increasing your daily cleaning and scheduling regular deep cleanings will help keep germs at bay in the workplace.
