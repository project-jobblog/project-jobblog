How To Align Your Personality With Your Career? You can probably think of a friend who is unhappy with their job and wishes they could be somewhere (anywhere) else in less than 10 seconds. While you may not always be able to locate the ideal job for you, you may discover one that fits your personality. When your job feels like a natural extension of who you are, it&#8217;s much easier to fulfill your career goals.

### **When it comes to other people, what personality traits do you search for?**

The people you hang out with on a regular basis might reveal a lot about your personality. If you spend most of your time with outgoing people, you&#8217;re probably outgoing yourself. Look around at the people you spend the most time with, and you&#8217;ll see that their personalities reflect your own.

### **Take a look at how you interact with others**

You should first determine how you want to connect with other people before choosing the ideal career for your personality. Do you like to be extroverted or introverted? Do you wish to interact with people in person? Do you prefer to keep to yourself or do you love answering strangers&#8217; questions? Customer service, for example, is not a good career choice if you&#8217;re shy.
