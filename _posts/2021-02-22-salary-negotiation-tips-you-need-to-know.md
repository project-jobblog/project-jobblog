It can be tricky to negotiate a salary. When getting a great deal, here&#8217;s how to make a good impression.

You effectively convince the hiring manager after spending countless hours editing your resume and training in front of the mirror for the interview. Now it is time to think on how the highest salary can be negotiated.

It is just as necessary to discuss compensation and benefits as to tailor your professional resume for the job and prepare for the interview properly. Your style of salary negotiation shows an employer what type of team member you are. And while impressing your new employer is crucial, it&#8217;s just as important to make sure your new job offer pays the bills and respects your abilities and skills.

Sadly, during the interview process, not everyone is comfortable negotiating salaries. In reality, a [survey](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/ziprecruiter-2018-annual-job-seeker-survey/) found that 64% of respondents said they accepted the first salary offer they received the last time they were hired, which indicates that only 36% of professionals negotiated their salary at all.

If you find yourself shying away from the negotiation table, it&#8217;s time to conquer your fear! To ensure that you make a positive impression and earn a fair deal, take a deep breath, shake off the nerves, and apply these basic salary negotiation tips.

### **_Don&#8217;t hurry the job offer_**

Acceptance of the job offer on the spot is one of the most common and unfortunate [salary negotiation errors applicants make](/most-common-salary-negotiation-mistakes-to-avoid/). Although it is understandable that you need to feed the dog and pay the electricity bill, if you wait to offer your answer, you will yield greater rewards. Businesses often need to quickly fill a vacancy and will put more incentives on the table to close the deal. With this gamble, however, be careful; it might backfire.

Explain to the hiring manager that before making a decision, you would like to think things over and ask if this job offer has an expiration date. You should take the time to consider your salary negotiation strategy once you know the deadline to provide your response, find out how desperate the company is to fill the position, and show your prospective employer that you are a professional who does not rush to judgment.

### **Determine if wiggle room is there**

The first question you should ask after the interview team confirms its intention to hire you and the benefits package is revealed, **_&#8220;Is this negotiable?_** &#8220;You will be shocked by the response.

If the hiring manager says he can not make any adjustments, say that it&#8217;s not a concern, but ask if there is an opportunity in the near future to reconsider the compensation. Should the answer be no, pursuing other job opportunities might be a good idea.

### **Find out if this is a company offer or probationary status**

The rank you join the company with defines your ability to negotiate greater advantages. For instance, if you are recruited to take on the position of sales vice president by the board of directors, it could be a six-month probationary agreement with little negotiating space. A company [job offer](/category/job-offer/), on the other hand, offers more wiggle space. Only ask the hiring manager whether or not the business is extending a company job offer.

### **_Inquire about stock options_**

By talking about base pay and overall salary, you will impress the&#8217; numbers&#8217; people on the selection committee. Complete compensation suggests that all-inclusive is the contract on the table, while base pay is the basic salary plus any benefits and compensation.

This is the time to inquire whether there is an opportunity to buy the stock at a discounted price in the business and to find out if the company provides common benefits such as retirement insurance, travel, and living stipends, opportunities for professional advancement or training, or something else that might financially support you. For example, when they are expected to dress more professionally, certain news outlets will give on-air reporters a clothing stipend. Sometimes, occupations that require a lot of travel provide a stipend for mobile phones and petrol.

### **_Sign On the dotted line_**

Never, ever, without getting the information in writing, accept a job or bid. In any sort of contract, your salary and benefits package should be reflected. Start questioning the professionalism of the business and its management if none is presented. When he or she signs a benefits agreement, most organizations will not recruit a new team member. This not only safeguards the new recruit, but also the business. In the future, any enterprise that doesn&#8217;t follow this strategy may have legal problems.

### **_Still hold open your eyes for better possibilities_**

And if you plan to embrace the job and the advantages that accompany it, never turn a blind eye to other career development opportunities. Some may be present inside the company, and others may be identified at a professional networking event outside the workplace. Treat your personal brand the same way any business would treat its customer brand: encourage, sell, and expand.
