Here are some reasons why researching a company before, during, and after applying for a job: Before applying for a job, do some research on the company.

 

### **If the pay meets your expectations, you&#8217;ll know**s

One of the more obvious arguments, although it&#8217;s more nuanced than it appears at first glance.

You can just be looking at the yearly amount for your payment package and thinking it&#8217;s enough. However, if you&#8217;re fresh out of college and this is your first employment, it&#8217;s critical to understand the whole picture before signing that contract.

Is the salary they&#8217;re offering gross or net (before or after taxes)? Is there health insurance, paid vacation days (and how many? ), and 401(k) matching included in the compensation package? Are there any perks, such as free snacks and coffee, gym memberships, or free public transportation? All of these factors add up, so it&#8217;s vital to know the whole value of a company&#8217;s compensation package before accepting or declining an offer!

 
### **It assists you in determining whether the job and company are a good fit for you**

Salary negotiations can help you improve your compensation to some extent. What you can&#8217;t change, however, is the job you&#8217;ll be assigned to and the business culture.

Let&#8217;s pretend you wish to work as a digital marketer. As you may be aware, the responsibilities of a digital marketing position vary widely from firm to organization. While a digital marketer at Company A might plan large-scale, international advertising campaigns, the same job title at Company B might see you writing landing page copy and managing social media. Thoroughly research the company and the job will help you understand what you&#8217;re getting yourself into.

The company is in the same boat. You may have discovered your [dream job](/how-to-figure-out-if-you-are-right-for-the-job/), complete with amazing income, bonuses, and benefits, but is it a company you can support? Do they have a strong moral compass? For example, if you oppose animal cruelty, you don&#8217;t want to find out after you join up that they do product testing on rabbits. Similarly, if you&#8217;re concerned about the environment, you might reconsider if you hear that the company you&#8217;re considering is a large polluter.

### **It allows you to fine-tune your resume**

### **It allows you to customize your cover letter**

For similar reasons, researching a company before drafting a cover letter is also one of our most crucial [cover letter suggestions](/cover-letter-tips-for-new-freelancers/). Your cover letter will help you make your case to the HR representative or hiring manager who is sifting through the dozens of applications they have received, and you&#8217;ll have a better sense of what to include.

For example, before writing your cover letter, do some research on the startup or organization to learn about its vision, goals, and motivation. Then you can talk about how their goals and mission are similar to yours. You can also show off your unique side while writing if the organization has a quirky culture.

 

### **It finds the correct person to whom you should send your email**

To say the least, sending your CV and cover letter to hello@companyX.com or contact@companyZ.org is unprofessional. Furthermore, it is possible that it will not reach the intended recipient.

When you do your research on the company, you&#8217;ll be able to easily obtain the name of the recruiting manager or human resources supervisor so you can send an email to them immediately. After all, first impressions are lasting impressions, and because this is the company&#8217;s first &#8220;meeting,&#8221; make sure you don&#8217;t turn them off right away!

### **It helps you prepare for the interview**

Interviews, no matter how well or long you&#8217;ve prepared for them, maybe nerve-wracking. And those pauses, even if they are only three seconds long, might seem to last an eternity!

You&#8217;ll truly impress your interviewer if you can answer their questions about how you can help them reach their long-term goals and what you think about their current marketing efforts, company culture, and mission swiftly and without missing a beat. If you haven&#8217;t done your homework about the firm, people will lose interest when they see that you can&#8217;t answer their queries and couldn&#8217;t be bothered to prepare!

 

### **It&#8217;ll demonstrate that you&#8217;re enthusiastic about the prospect of being hired**

Conducting research on the company demonstrates your enthusiasm for the possibility of becoming a future employee. They&#8217;ll notice how hard you worked to prepare for the interview by doing your homework, but they&#8217;ll also get the impression that you sincerely want to work for them and give it you&#8217;re all.

If everything else stays the same, you&#8217;ll have the job!
