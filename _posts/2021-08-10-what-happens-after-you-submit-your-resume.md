What happens after you submit your resume? Are you having trouble securing interviews for the positions you&#8217;ve applied for? You&#8217;re not getting any responses to your job postings? I&#8217;ve got the inside scoop on what happens when you submit your resume for an open position as a long-serving professional in the talent acquisition industry. Let&#8217;s take a look at how it works:



### **Importance of Keywords**

Candidates must first figure out who — or what — is looking over their resumes. An HR assistant, a hiring manager, or an Applicant Tracking System could be the culprit (ATS). These resources usually run a fast first scan of the content to look for specific keywords. “**Are the keywords from the job description in my resume?**” candidates should question themselves. If they aren&#8217;t already there, add them!

### **Give a Professional Overview**

The majority of the time, the resources examining candidate resumes do so from the top down. Provide a brief professional summary—two to three sentences—at the beginning of your resume to improve your chances of moving on to the next round. This should include details about who you are, where you want to go, what skills you have, and how you would apply them to the new position. Then, just below the summary section, I often suggest candidates include those all-important keywords. Before starting your work history, including a section called &#8220;important skills&#8221; to catch the attention of the HR assistant who is examining your resume.

### **Take The Phone**

A formal interview request will be sent if the hiring manager approves your resume and wants to learn more about your past. Someone from the company will almost certainly contact you, whether via email or phone. If you&#8217;re applying for open opportunities, I usually advise job searchers to answer calls from unknown numbers and be ready for specifics about the interview to be supplied over the phone.

### **Complete Your Homework**

If you are chosen to participate in the interview process, make sure you are familiar with the company and the people you will be speaking with.

### **Mirror Your LinkedIn P{rofile**

If the hiring manager hasn&#8217;t already done so, your resume will be forwarded to them, who will begin by scanning the top of the page for critical keywords. Your profile may also be found on LinkedIn or other social media channels by the hiring manager. It&#8217;s always a good idea to match the layout of your LinkedIn profile to the layout of your resume. Make your social networking channels, such as Facebook and Twitter. Allowing these networks to divulge any potentially incriminating formation about you is not a good idea!



Applying for jobs can appear to be a tedious and time-consuming procedure. With so many submission requirements, such as resumes and cover letters, it will be much easier for candidates to take the easy route and utilize one standard version for each application. However, by taking the time to implement these suggestions and include personalized keywords in your resume, you will increase your chances of landing an interview and moving one step closer to securing a job.
