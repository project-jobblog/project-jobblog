Responding to a withdrawn job offer appropriately gives you control of your current and future career options.

One of those exciting moments of life, until it is not, is getting a job offer. While rare, there are times when, often without warning and sometimes without explanation, a job offer will be withdrawn.

Understanding how to react to a rescinded job offer includes knowing why it happened, learning what is and is not in your control, and how to respond professionally.

### **_Knowing why Job offers are rescinded_**

Companies do not benefit from rescinding a job offer due to the cost of wasted time and resources and will not do it unless they believe it is the only option.

It&#8217;s usually due to one of these circumstances when an offer is taken back:

  1. Due to an unforeseen change within the company, the role is no longer open or has been put on indefinite hold. This can range from financial difficulty, to a mandated reduction of headcount within a particular department, or from the person in the job deciding not to leave.
  2. A candidate makes a post-offer that has the business thinking twice about bringing that individual on board.

**_Examples are:_**

  * The individual continually puts off signing the official letter of offer and is not in touch with the hiring manager. This means that the applicant is not organized, has poor communication abilities, or is not passionate about the job.
  * The candidate tries to negotiate a higher starting salary on the basis of an offer from another company after the initial offer.
  * After receiving an offer, unprofessional actions or attitudes towards the company, including the two examples above or negative comments made on social media sites.
  * They discover that the candidate was not truthful about their abilities, experience, or education during a background and/or reference check.

It is more often candidate actions and not business variables that lead to an offer being withdrawn, according to recruiting managers and human resources professionals, although in reality a job offer can be rescinded for just about any reason that is not considered discriminatory.

### **_How to reduce the chances of job offer withdrawal_**

In addition to avoiding the above post-offer errors, through how they act during the interview process, candidates can also decrease the chance of job offer withdrawal. These are the elements that are absolutely in your power:

  * Is there something in your background that could end in a rescinded offer once the company discovers it, bad credit, social media posts? Be ready during the interview to address this. In a background or reference check, it is better for a hiring manager to hear about it from you with an explanation than to stumble on it later.
  * In what you say and how you act, always be professional.
  * Don&#8217;t lie on your CV.
  * When answering interview questions, be honest; don&#8217;t stretch the truth to make yourself seem more qualified than you are.

Be proactive along with these tips, and talk to your point person about what would happen if the job offer was revoked by some chance. How soon are you going to know? Ask whether all the details can be reflected in your offer letter, as well as whether or not you can keep any signing bonus or advance.

### **_How to respond to a rescinded Job offer_**

If, despite all your best efforts, the offer is rescinded, there are some specific actions you can take to learn why and possibly keep the door open if it was only a company problem:

  * Negotiate further possibilities: See if you can work as [internship](/how-to-turn-your-internship-into-a-full-time-job/), part-time or work in a different department to show them what you can do if you have the flexibility and really love the company. Asking never hurts.
  * Do not stop your job search: There is no guarantee that this job will be available again or that the most qualified candidate will still be considered to be you. Until you have signed a written offer for this or any other job, keep all of your options open and continue to interview for other roles.

  </p>

  * Get an explanation for that: Stay calm, let the company know that you are disappointed in losing this chance, and ask for a thorough explanation of their decision. The data can stop you from making repeated mistakes or confirm that it was an unforeseen corporate issue.
  * Check for a potential time frame for reopening: If it&#8217;s a corporate problem, ask if there is any chance that the job will be open again and when that could be. Let your contact know that when it is available, you still would like to be considered for the job as of that moment.
  * Follow Up: Near the end of any waiting period, follow up with the company by email. You&#8217;ll have to decide from there if you want to continue checking back or just move on.

### **_Know your legal rights_**

While an employer can cancel a job offer at will, for reasons linked to race, age, gender, religion, or national origin, it can not do so. You may want to seek legal help if you feel that your offer has been withdrawn based on these discriminatory factors.

Finally, until you have signed a formal job offer document and know that you have met all of the hiring requirements of the company, don&#8217;t resign from your current position. In addition, if the worst is going to happen and the offer is taken back after you have quit your current job, have a detailed backup plan.

Until you finally walk through the door on that first day of your new job, planning ahead on how to respond to a withdrawn job offer keeps you in control.
