How To Find That One Perfect Job? Increasing concern has risen in the US about a lack of skilled workers to fill job openings, resulting in a high unemployment rate even as there are thousands of vacancies in the job market. The large gap between the skill requirements of companies and those available in the talent pool is often cited as one of the main reasons for holding back the economic development of the country.

It is a no-win situation to apply for jobs without possessing suitable skills. During the selection process, companies almost always weed out such candidates. This is why it is crucial to decide whether you have the right skills along with qualifications for the job if you apply for a position. If you are on the right track, here&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll know:

### **List your skills and capabilities**

Basic skills, the ability to learn new things, reading, listening, critical thinking. individual skills(also known as soft skills, management skills, system skills, the ability to understand how an organization works and technical skills can be of different kinds (proficiency with technology). Create a list of the skills that you believe you possess. You might also ask someone you&#8217;ve been working with to list your ability.

### **Carefully read the job postings**

Match the skill criteria detailed with your skill sheet in the job listing to see if you are going to be a good match for the job. Try to be as objective as possible. If the job needs management skills, for example, and you have put down &#8216;organizational skills&#8217; as an asset, don&#8217;t assume that this is the job for you. Know that there is a distinction between handling people and sorting things.

### **Visualize the Job**

It is a good idea to try to believe that you have been chosen. Now determine whether you will be able to do the job justice. To grasp what the work entails, talk to individuals in the industry. Do you have the skills needed for the job already, or do you need to learn new ones? If the list of abilities you need to learn is longer than the list of skills you already own, it&#8217;s always a good idea to opt out.

### **Place yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager**

For a moment, try to picture yourself as the **hiring manager**. In the ideal candidate, what abilities do you think you would like to see? In order to satisfy your demands, what kind of credentials does the candidate need to have? What kind of career experience would you be impressed with? It&#8217;s not easy to think from the viewpoint of the hiring manager, but it will give you some insight into the job&#8217;s requirements.

During the selection stage, applicants lacking the right qualifications for the job are almost always discarded. Even if you make it through the selection process, chances are you&#8217;re going to fail at work. For both you and your boss, this is a lose-lose scenario. Instead, since you would have a greater chance of being chosen,  **target jobs that are ideally suited to your talents.**
