What motivates you the most? What Is Your Biggest Motivation? What pushes you to get up and start the day every day? This interview question&#8217;s answer can be purely subjective; there is no right or incorrect answer.

We can, however, assist you in understanding why you are being asked this question, the best strategy to take, and samples of excellent and bad responses.

### **Why is motivation important to the interviewer?**

Motivation is a desirable quality among potential employees, according to most employers. From the standpoint of an employer, if you are motivated, you are determined, you will go the additional mile, and you will put your heart and soul into the job at hand.

## **How to respond to an interview question surrounding motivation**

If you&#8217;re not sure how to respond, start by asking yourself the following questions:

### **Why did you choose this particular role?**

What first drew you to the position? Perhaps your abilities and expertise are a perfect match for the job description, or you&#8217;re searching for additional responsibility, which this position may provide.

There are numerous justifiable rationales that you should write down and consider before making your decision.

### **What does it mean to you to be motivated?**

Motivation is what fuels your desire to be inspired and pushes you to complete tasks. Which can be as simple as a cup of coffee in the morning or as difficult as the technical aspects of your profession that you excel in.

### **What about the job/company piques your interest?**

What drew you to this line of work? If you have a career that is more than simply a &#8220;job,&#8221; this is likely to be your response to determining your greatest motivator.

Was the possible employer a factor in your decision? For some job seekers, an established company with a well-known brand might be quite motivating. Or the company&#8217;s potential, growth strategy, and future make you want to be a part of it.

**Bad motivation examples**

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    “The paycheck.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Friday&#8217;s prospects.”
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Good motivation examples**

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    “Having a real interest in what I do is the most motivating factor for me. I am enthusiastic about my work, and finding a position that can match that, as well as a firm that shares my beliefs, allows me to perform at my best.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Working on a project that I am looking forward to starting every day is a source of motivation for me. When work becomes enjoyable, I believe it makes a significant difference in my performance and the quality of the job I produce.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Working in an environment where I am recognized and appreciated is one of my most motivating factors. Working as part of a productive team makes it simpler to get out of bed in the morning, go to work, project new ideas, explore new directions, and push one another to do our best. Because, at the end of the day, we all want the same thing.”
