If you want to reenter the workforce after taking time off or want to try a new profession later in life, for individuals over 50, there are many satisfying employment opportunities. We will address the best occupations for over-50-year-olds in this post, along with average incomes and primary duties. A flexible or part-time work schedule is used in most of these occupations.

## What are the best jobs for over 50 years old professionals?

### Administrative assistant

**Primary duties**: Clerical tasks are performed by administrative assistants, such as filing papers, organizing paperwork, welcoming guests and assisting staff members. They respond to phones and route calls, make appointments and plan plans and supervise filing systems. Most develop memos, prepare invoices and draft reports. Many administrative assistants often manage simple bookkeeping responsibilities and handle office supplies. Depending on the business or industry they operate in, the day-to-day duties can also vary.

**Requirements**: You need a high school diploma and basic programming and organizational skills to become an administrative assistant.

**Average National Salary**: $15.36 per hour 

### Medical Record Technician

**Main Duties:** In digital databases and paper filing systems, medical records technicians handle patient health information. It is the duty of these practitioners to study classification systems, to codify patient records and to document medical histories. Medical records technicians also initiate reimbursements for benefits and help doctors track patient results. Medical records technicians must uphold a clear sense of confidentiality at work due to the sensitive nature of these files.

**Requirements**: You have to earn a high school diploma and complete a post-secondary health information program to become a medical records technician. Many medical record technicians have a certificate or aspire to obtain one shortly after getting a job from a licensed health information technician.

**Average National Salary**: $13.14 per hour

 

### Tutor

**Main Duties:** It is the duty of tutors to help students develop skills and master subjects. They teach students how to study for exams, take classroom notes, and finish their homework. If tutors work one-on-one or in small groups of students, they aim to help students in school get better grades. Tutors generally operate outside a typical learning atmosphere for students, often teaching students in tutoring centers, at home, or online. They work with a range of school ages, including children in or about to go to college, adolescents, and young adults.

**Requirements**: You need at least a high school diploma to become a teacher and to be well-versed in the subject you are tutoring. The National Tutoring Association, the American Tutoring Association, or a similar organization might also need qualifications for certain positions.

**Average National Salary**: $21.45 per hour 


### Mail Carrier

**Primary Duties**: On an allocated delivery route, mail carriers are responsible for delivering letters and packages. They will also sort and prepare mail, as well as along their route collect outgoing deliveries. For certain specialty deliveries, postal carriers may also be responsible for obtaining signatures or payments.

**Requirements:** A high school diploma or equivalent along with a clean background check and a valid driver&#8217;s license is typically required for mail carriers. They may be expected to pass a particular test as well.

**Average National Salary**: $19.11 per hour 

### Bus Driver

**Primary tasks**: It is the responsibility of bus drivers to pick up and drop off bus passengers, whether on a public transit bus, school bus or any other private or public transportation service.

### Massage Therapist

**Main duties:** Massage exercises are used by these practitioners to treat injuries, enhance circulation, aid recovery and promote health. By designing personalized recovery plans that meet individual needs, they also address symptoms and set healing goals for consumers. Many massage therapists often advise clients on stretching, posture and other components that can enhance their well-being.

**Requirements**: You need to complete a post-secondary program to become a massage therapist, which usually requires 500 to 1,000 hours of training. The majority of states also require you to have a license for CPR and a massage therapist. While several states require you to pass the Licensing Test for Massage and Bodywork, others have state-specific licensing exams.

Writers also specialize in certain subjects or forms, such as blogs and digital content, and many work on a contract or freelance basis.

**Requirements**: You normally need a bachelor&#8217;s degree in English or communications to become a writer, although some entry-level and freelance positions will require only a portfolio of previous work to show your writing skills. You will also require formal qualification to validate your qualifications if you intend to specialize in grant writing or technical writing.
