Are you struggling to pull yourself out of bed every day in the morning and spend the next eight hours wishing you were anywhere else but at work? And are you going home, eating to the content of your heart, but then spending the night tossing and turning in bed? If you&#8217;ve answer &#8216;yes&#8217; to all those questions, then without even realizing it, you could be struggling with a little bit of something called burnout.

That said, our body always gives us warning signs; before it&#8217;s too late, we just need to keep a lookout for them. Some common signs of workplace burnout include:

  * Feeling angry and annoyed and highly self-critical and self-doubting for no reason.
  * Getting frustrated with everyday activities such as going shopping for food or being in crowded areas
  * Becoming uninterested in things you once loved, such as cycling or swimming.
  * Feeling continually tired and not having the desire to do something
  * Interrupted sleep and flu-like symptoms are experienced
  * Experiencing a loss of focus, frequently feeling your mind zoning out and not being able to complete a single assignment

### **_Ask for flexibility_**

Approach your manager and ask for some flexibility if you like you&#8217;re at the end of your tether.
