Are you bored at work? Have you had a raise in a while? We&#8217;ll show you how to figure out whether you should leave your job or stay put in order to advance your career.

### **You&#8217;re not getting promoted**

Getting promoted in today&#8217;s workplace has less to do with years of service and more to do with productivity and ambition.

People in charge of promotion decisions are always on the lookout for people with skills that warrant advancement. Put yourself forward for opportunities that pique your interest and could lead to a boost in your profile.

Speak with the boss about taking on more responsibilities or taking control of office activities. If suitable tasks and duties are still unavailable, you must choose whether to continue or pursue a new challenge.

### **There hasn&#8217;t been any new training for you**

Throughout your career, you can continue to learn. Often check with your boss to see if there are any courses or certifications you can seek.

There&#8217;s always the risk of being left behind on the career ladder if you&#8217;re not given the chance to learn new skills. It may be time to change jobs if they don&#8217;t seem interested.

### **Your hard work goes unnoticed**

Pay raises or promotions, being consulted, and being given the opportunity to learn new skills or take on new roles are all examples of recognition.

If you&#8217;re feeling neglected, underappreciated, or like you&#8217;ve been written off by your boss, it&#8217;s time to look for a new job.

### **You&#8217;re tired of being bored**

Do you feel like every day is the same and you&#8217;re only going through the motions with no hope of changing things?

If it does, or if you notice that you&#8217;re no longer concerned about doing a good job, it&#8217;s time to reconsider your options.

### **You can&#8217;t see a future**

You&#8217;ll ultimately quit if your boss can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t promote you.

Similarly, if you fear being promoted because it would just create more issues, you can reconsider your reasons for staying. If you don&#8217;t think your employer will provide you with significant career advancement in a fair amount of time, it&#8217;s time to move on.

### **Unhealthy work-life balance**

You need a [work-life balance](/category/work-life-balance/) that suits you, no matter how much you enjoy your job.

If you&#8217;re feeling irritated with your work hours, your workload never seems to get any easier, or work keeps following you home, it&#8217;s time to consider rebalancing your life.

### **You&#8217;ve also attempted to change the situation**

If you&#8217;re having a problem at work, your boss might be willing to assist you in solving it.

However, if you&#8217;ve been through the correct channels and nothing appears to be improving, it might be easier to change jobs.





## **How to Decide If It&#8217;s Time to Leave Your Job**

If you&#8217;re unhappy at work, it&#8217;s likely that it&#8217;ll affect your overall satisfaction.

Although leaving a job isn&#8217;t anything you can take lightly, it&#8217;s also something you shouldn&#8217;t put off.

### **Have you spent enough time in your current position?**

Although your gut can tell you that your new job isn&#8217;t for you on the first day, it takes time to feel at ease in a new position.

You should give it six months, according to the general consensus. Spend the next six months learning as many transferable skills as you can, making as many business connections as you can, and having as much of an effect on the company as you possibly can.

Although you may not have enjoyed your time there, you would have gained valuable information that you can apply to your next interview.

However, despite your best efforts, you might find yourself ready to move on.

### **Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?**

If you&#8217;re still undecided, consider the aspects of your current job that you like and dislike, and equate them to the benefits and drawbacks of the new job in question.

Whether it&#8217;s a change in pay, the length of your commute, the business benefits on offer, or a shift in organizational culture, all of these factors play a role in your long-term work satisfaction.

This way of thinking about a career change will help you see things critically and make the best decision possible.
