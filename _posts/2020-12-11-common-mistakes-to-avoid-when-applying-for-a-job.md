While having a good job career background and skillset, applicants often miss out on a good opportunity. Some of them commit mistakes that lead to recruiters&#8217; dismissal.

**_Here are the mistakes to be avoided by job-seekers_**

### Not following the guidelines

It is better to stick to it if a recruiter states that phone calls are not welcome. It not only ensures that the resume reaches the right person with the right details at the right time but also shows your ability to take directions.

### Getting Gimmicky

In an attempt to draw the attention of a recruiter, many applicants turn to flashy formatting in the comments section, including fancy footers, flamboyant language, or even personal pleas. Recruiters do not spend more than a few seconds reading a CV and they are only likely to go through it in depth if it evokes their curiosity. So, ensure smart formatting and the right word range.

### Getting Generic

Job portals offer you the opportunity to apply to all positions in the fastest way by clicking &#8216;[Apply Now](/high-paying-jobs-that-dont-require-a-degree/)&#8216; just once. However, this method is best avoided. Instead, use and edit the preview option to suit the role on offer. Customizing the work application is really important. Sometimes many career searchers send-community e-mails to recruiters and generic resumes. This is the worst error that can be made, and cuts a very shabby picture and reveals the desperation, lacking enthusiasm, and determined attitude of the applicant.

### Incomplete job application

Instead of leaving recruiters guessing, do your bit and include all the necessary information, as is the case sometimes. Time-crunched recruiters, who are swamped every day by hundreds of resumes, typically end up wasting time on applications that are complete and do not need the information to ferret out.

### Applying a job in a hurry

companies recruit on the basis of what the candidate brings to the table and not on a first-come-first-serve basis, Never hurry, then! Before submitting them, double-check the request &#8211; information on the job board, resume, and cover letter. A negative impression would be generated by applications and cover letters filled with typos, followed by [unformatted resumes](https://woman.thenest.com/unformatted-resume-17472.html#:~:text=An%20unformatted%20resume%20is%20a,them%20bold%2C%20underlined%20or%20italicized.).

### Not following up

Follow-ups are also required for online applications. For example, it is better to follow up on your application if you do not hear from the recruiter within seven to 10 days. Any other day, don&#8217;t call or mail recruiters. The trick is to be respectful and when inquiring about your application, show interest in the job.
