When a valuable employee quits your company, it&#8217;s understandable that finding and recruiting a great applicant to replace them becomes a top priority. After all, every day that an empty desk is unoccupied is a day of lost production. While we understand that this might be aggravating, we also understand the importance of taking the time to discover the finest job prospect for your company.

We&#8217;ve seen the same mistakes made in the hiring process time and time again in recruitment. Many of these blunders arise from one of two issues: hiring managers either don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re looking for in a new recruit or don&#8217;t know how to evaluate candidates for it during the job interview process.

Spending some time developing a position description can solve the first of these problems. The second problem can be overcome by extensive interview preparation, which includes knowing what types of interview questions to ask in order to assess candidates for the required abilities, behaviors, and cultural fit.

Importantly, you are not only evaluating each candidate&#8217;s hard or technical skills during an interview. While this is critical, you must also examine candidates for less technical but equally important soft skills such as emotional intelligence, teamwork, and problem-solving.

Simple ways to discover what you&#8217;re truly looking for in candidates are outlined here, along with specific ideas for measuring this criterion during the interview process to ensure you choose the best candidate for your firm.

### **How do you evaluate soft skills?**

You should also ask questions to see if the prospect possesses the soft skills required for the position. Soft skills are inborn characteristics that are more difficult to teach and assess. So, how do you know what soft talents the ideal candidate will have?

Consider your job description and which soft skills might be beneficial to someone in the role. You might be looking for a sales executive, for example, and need someone who can create rapport with stakeholders. As a result, you&#8217;ll need people who can work well with others. Consider what qualities the prior job holder held that were useful to the role – as well as what qualities he or she lacked.

Most likely, your recruiter will meet the prospect before you do, and many soft talents are far better shown in person. Keeping your recruiter informed and involved will enable them to screen for the necessary soft and technical capabilities, providing you with the best shortlist to choose from throughout the interview process.

How can you evaluate a candidate&#8217;s soft abilities in an interview once they are in front of you? You can ask competency-based interview questions to learn about their soft skills once again. “Can you describe how you&#8217;ve created a profitable relationship with a client in the past?” for example.

You can also read between the lines to evaluate how each candidate displays soft skills, such as how they speak to you as a senior stakeholder. Examine each candidate to see if they come across as a confident individual capable of establishing a rapport with important decision-makers.

When hiring for fresh talent, soft skills are important to consider because they may frequently distinguish between a candidate who is good on paper and one who is amazing in practice.

### **How do you evaluate hard skills?**

What are the most important technical requirements for the position you want to fill? Hard or technical skills are measurable abilities gained through practice and education. To discover the core hard skills required for success in the role, check your job description and speak with your line manager and important stakeholders. For instance, you might need a content writer who can type at 90 words per minute with 90 percent accuracy. You and your recruiter can shortlist the top candidates for the job by identifying important technical abilities.

During the interview process, how can you assess candidates&#8217; hard skills? Begin by developing competence interview questions that will encourage candidates to provide examples of when they have displayed these abilities in the past. Competency-based interview questions, as previously mentioned, help you to learn about and analyze abilities and knowledge related to the position, allowing you to hire the best new employee.

You can also have candidates conduct a practical exam before or during the interview. Such evaluations should represent the skills needed to succeed in the role on a day-to-day basis. You could, for example, use the preceding example to create a typing test to assess speed and accuracy.

If you&#8217;re still unsure and need to fill numerous positions, your recruiter can set up an assessment center to see how candidates react to specific scenarios relating to the job you&#8217;re interviewing for.

### **How do you analyze your career goals?**

Finally, consider the prospects for professional advancement, training, and development within this role and team. Then, during your interviews, ask questions to assess each candidate&#8217;s career aspirations and whether they are likely to take advantage of the given chances. “Where do you see yourself in five years?” and “What are you looking for in this job?” are two examples of questions you could ask. If applicants cannot provide a detailed response that indicates they have the potential to be long-term employees, this business or opportunity may not be suited for them.

You should also inquire about their training and growth expectations. If internal advancement and growth are important to your staff retention strategy, you&#8217;ll want to hire someone with similar career aspirations.

### **How do you figure out if you&#8217;re culturally compatible?**

Many employers look at qualifications and talents without considering if the candidate will fit in with the rest of the team, the organization, and the corporate culture. Many recruiting managers, however, are so focused on evaluating each candidate&#8217;s technical and soft skills that they barely examine whether they are the proper fit. However, a poor match is the most common reason for someone being fired or leaving an organization.

Before your interviews, consider how you would characterize your team, organization, and culture to avoid making this mistake and hiring the ideal applicant for your company. For example, you may work in a small company where everyone is friendly and team-oriented, and where collaboration and a customer-first mentality are prized. If that&#8217;s the case, keep an eye out for these qualities in prospects throughout the interview.

Preparing behavioral interview questions will assist you in gaining a better understanding of each candidate&#8217;s personality traits and motivations. “Tell me about a moment when you had to work well in a team to attain a hard objective,” for example, in the case above.

You can also meet with other team members in person or electronically to introduce the candidate. Let these people know what you&#8217;re looking for in a candidate so they can ask the right questions and give you input on how well they think this person would fit into the company culture.

### **A successful hiring procedure**

In conclusion, it is critical to analyze each candidate&#8217;s soft skills, working style, and ambition in addition to technical qualifications. While these variables are more difficult to assess, doing so can help you locate, hire, and retain the best candidate for the job.
