Are you looking for a new job opportunity and don&#8217;t know where to start? You have come to the right place.

Here, we have listed five hot jobs in the United States.

### Data Analysts

With businesses collecting more and more data, it is no wonder that the demand for trained data analysts is growing. Data analysts will become highly relevant in most industries by 2021, according to research by the World Economic Forum. Leveraging data will become a major activity for businesses by providing the ability to distil previously unknown insights and unveil new market value for brands. At the core of that growth, data scientists will sit. 

### Specialised Roles in Sales

Sales teams need to become more specialized with new technology transforming whole markets, and applicants will need to possess niche tech expertise and knowledge. Although technology companies may be at the forefront of this growth, it is sales teams that make automation and other processes become recognizable to other industries and organizations. For example, with mobile, marketing, advertising and digital media companies increasingly consuming content, sales teams with in-depth knowledge of mobile and advertising technology are required.  

### Human Resources

The scope of our employment is also evolving as technology is changing the way we work. This implies that human resource practitioners not only need to locate individuals with specific abilities, but they also need to spearhead the reskilling of the employees of the company. HR managers are no longer merely attracting top talents, but are also engaged in the preparation and scaling of the company as it is important to improve the skills of the employees.
