The job market is quite a confusing and difficult problem. In order to get professional experience, you need a job, but you need professional experience to get the job. Job experience is an added benefit today, especially for senior positions. But when it&#8217;s your first ever job, how do you join the workforce?

### Internships, apprenticeships and volunteer programs

Internships and apprenticeships are one of the easiest opportunities for someone with no technical experience to get a job. Not only can these channels provide the much needed experience, but they can also help you secure a permanent role. Another perfect way of joining the professional world without any experience is volunteering. It lets you develop characteristics that favor you in the long run, such as determination, initiative and good work-ethics.

It would support the case to demonstrate a history of achievement by events that you took part in or the roles you held in school or college, and even fundraising for a college function, among others.

### Work for experience

Based on your experience, you should be realistic about the payoff and should concentrate on acquiring information instead.

Not only can this help you obtain a special interest from the employer, but at 18 years old, it will also improve your employability chances.

But, be assured that it can be achieved with dedication, earnestness, and a little bit of versatility. In your own right, you will need to persevere and prove this to yourself.
