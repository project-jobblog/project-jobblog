They said that the first impressions last a lifetime, so whether you have an incoming interview or a big sales meeting coming, it is important to make sure you give them your best.

It also just takes a few moments for someone to check, analyze, and make a decision about you when they see you for the very first time. Here are a few strategies you can use to avoid giving off a negative impression.

### Prepare Properly

It is important that you prepare everything in order to make a great first impression. When you are prepared, you will feel confident. It will give you the chance to focus on the person you are meeting and not wondering about your answer. It will show during the meeting if you are prepared or not, preparing before the meeting will also lessen if not remove the jitters of pre-interview. When you prepare you will be able to display confidence and it will make a big difference, so prepare and do your due diligence.

  * Where will it take place? How long will it take you to be there? How to go there?
  * Who are you going to meet? Their position?
  * What do you think will be the questions?
  * Do research about the company or the person you will be meeting.
  * Can you provide them the relevant information about yourself, experience, and goals?

### Be punctual

People hate it when the person they are meeting is late. So, make sure that you are at least 5 minutes early to the meeting place or location. While being late will make you look really bad, being too early will probably give them a wrong impression about you, so it is better to be only at least 5 minutes early. That will give you time to calm your nerves or get comfortable. Also, if you are quite far from the meeting place, make sure that you will give a time allowance to yourself just in case there are unforeseen circumstances.

### Be true and confident

Your body language is the first thing someone can notice from you. This involves standing tall and upright, smiling, making contact with the eye, and saluting the person with a good handshake. All of this will not only make everyone feel more secure but will also project confidence.

You can always start with some casual small talk to ease the stress if you feel very shy. It&#8217;s a perfect way to set off a nice conversation.

### Pay attention

Although there should be good etiquette and respectful actions, you will need to be as attentive as you can be. Since you don&#8217;t want to give the impression that you are easily distracted, don&#8217;t be distracted by small stuff and other people. That said, make sure the cell phone is silent. Do balance speaking and listening as well. You can try to engage your discussion partner with questions if you feel like you are dominating the meeting.
