Are you needed to present your resume in order to secure an internship, and you&#8217;re unsure how your resume should look for such an internship? Are you afraid of being overqualified or underqualified? Do you fall into one or more of the categories mentioned above, making it difficult for you to get your resume in front of the right people? Then this article is tailored to your needs.

Since your resume is essentially an introduction to your employer, writing resumes can be a difficult task. As a result, you can be assured that first impressions count. The recruiter or employer has no idea who you are or your previous accomplishments, no matter how impressive they may be, so always try to articulate rather than impress.

The recruiter is more likely to be interested in learning about who you are as an individual than in learning about your accomplishments, which are likely to be few considering that you are applying for an internship.

The average recruiter looks at a resume for no more than six seconds and would only look at it for longer if the six-second glance was worthwhile.

So, please look inwards and try and think of a way to build a relationship with the recruiter in less than six seconds. You&#8217;re probably wondering how on earth anyone could do anything like that. That&#8217;s correct, and you&#8217;ll find out how to do it right here.

The first step in writing your resume is to go over your past experiences and see if you&#8217;ve done something that is even remotely relevant to the job you&#8217;re applying for.

**As an example**, If you&#8217;re applying for an internship at a **digital marketing** agency, any background in an area like social media management should be highlighted. Look for occasions when you managed every social media account for any brand, even if it was for a personal account, and convert it into a corporate experience.

You should be assured that the recruiter or company does not expect you to have serious technical credentials and that your current qualifications are only meant to boost your academic or career aspirations, so you can include all of the skills you acquired on your own and demonstrate a desire to learn more skills when writing your resume for an internship.

### **Basics of a Resume for an Internship**

  * Avoid spelling and grammatical mistakes, and make your resume easy to read.
  * Make sure your resume is just one page long.
  * It should be well-structured and perfectly highlight your strengths.
  * Preambles are unnecessary; instead, get straight to the point and make the position you&#8217;re applying for as clear as possible.

The recruiter does not expect you to have a lot of experience, but that does not give you the right to fill out your resume with generic material, as this sends a negative message to the recruiter about you.

Also, bear in mind that the recruiters are searching for someone who has honed their abilities through personal experience and is eager to learn.

Skills such as the ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines, a high degree of ingenuity, outstanding communication skills, hard work, and excellent leadership abilities are only a few examples.

When writing a resume for an internship, it&#8217;s normal to see many students stressed out or having a nervous breakdown because of their GPA.

If you fall into this group, take a deep breath and stop raising your blood pressure because, in most situations, recruiters do not consider your school GPA when deciding whether or not you deserve to be recruited.

Even if your academic credentials are low, make sure to include them on your resume because you do not have enough field experience for someone in your stage, and as previously stated, even recruiters do not expect you to.

Recruiters are typically more interested in previous job experiences, so please emphasize that.

There are a few basic points on your resume that should strike your recruiter first, one of which is your &#8216;Professional Summary,&#8217; which is where you tell your recruiter what you have to say in just a few sentences.

Always provide a technical description of your resume, since this is the perfect way to let your boss know what you&#8217;re good at or what you&#8217;re good at.

Your resume should be customized to the role you&#8217;re applying for, since this will give the recruiter the impression that you&#8217;re already a good candidate for the business before you&#8217;re even offered a job.

Always remember to include all of the awards and honors you&#8217;ve got, no matter how minor they might be; they go a long way toward leaving a lasting impression on your employer&#8217;s mind and giving you an edge of prestige over other resumes.

With all of the information given above, you should be well on your way to landing the dream internship, without a shadow of a doubt.
