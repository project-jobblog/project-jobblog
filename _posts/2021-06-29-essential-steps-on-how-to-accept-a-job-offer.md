For any job seeker, accepting a job offer is a triumphant moment. You&#8217;ve finally been offered the position you&#8217;ve been looking for after all of your studies, applying for positions, and interviewing. You&#8217;re ecstatic, which is understandable. However, don&#8217;t be so ready to get on board. [Accepting a job offer](/things-to-consider-before-accepting-a-job-offer/) is a crucial skill that every job seeker must master.

When an employer makes a job offer, they are practically laying their cards on the table, and they expect you to do the same—that is, to lay your cards on the table and accept the position on the spot. If you do that, you&#8217;re giving up your negotiating leverage. That was a bad decision.



**Follow these steps to learn how to accept a job offer properly:**


### **Thank the employer for the job offer**

Before you do anything else, thank the person who made the offer and express your excitement and gratitude, whether you&#8217;re conversing in person, on the phone, or via email.

Whether you&#8217;re going to respond with a counter-offer or accept the offer as is, getting the dialogue started in this manner establishes a positive tone.

Maintain your enthusiasm as you progress. Remember that the company is vulnerable—you might not accept their offer—so show your interest in the position to make them feel less uncomfortable. Using phrases like &#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled&#8221; will convey your enthusiasm without implying acceptance of the position.


### **Request that the offer be written down**

To learn how to accept a job offer, you must first understand what you&#8217;re agreeing to. Request that the offer be written after you&#8217;ve thanked the employer. At the absolute least, an official employment offer letter should include the title of the position, a start date, a salary, and information regarding benefits.

This step accomplishes two goals:

  * It allows you to properly analyze the facts to ensure that you fully comprehend what you&#8217;re being offered.
  * It formalizes the offer.

Inquire as to how long you have to respond after receiving the letter. If the employer demands a response right away, that&#8217;s a red flag. Accepting a job offer correctly necessitates due diligence, something a company is well aware of. It&#8217;s not a good idea to put pressure on you, and it&#8217;s often used as a scare technique. Before accepting a job offer, a prudent employer wants prospective employees to have some time to think about it—usually a day or two.

When it comes to pay negotiations, be prepared with the correct questions to ask and remember to negotiate in a collaborative, not contentious, tone. After all, you both want the same thing: to be in that position.

### **Be Prepared When Accepting a Job Offer**

When you&#8217;ve finished negotiating and are ready to accept, make sure to include all of the information in your acceptance.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    &#8220;It is my understanding that I will be entitled for X days of vacation, Y amount of bonus payable on Z, the company will cover 75% of my health care costs, and the company will match my 401K contributions up to the first 3% of my salary,&#8221;.
  </p>
</blockquote>

This is especially true if you&#8217;ve increased your offer from the initial offer. In reality, you should get a written copy of the final, formal offer.

Acknowledge that the negotiations took longer than expected in your acceptance. Negotiation is stressful for both parties, and once you accept an offer, expressing gratitude for your new employer&#8217;s time and effort shows you&#8217;re ready to move forward.

Finally, inquire about the following actions. Is there any onboarding paperwork you should start working on after accepting a job offer, for example? Is there going to be an orientation? What can you do to get ready for your first day? This demonstrates your enthusiasm, reassuring the organization that they made the right decision in hiring you.



### **Are you looking for a job?**

Now that you know how to accept a job offer, it&#8217;s evident that there&#8217;s a lot to think about before signing on the dotted line—even if you&#8217;re certain you&#8217;ve discovered the ideal job position. You must plan ahead of time.
