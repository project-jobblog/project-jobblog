Rather than awkwardly describing your greatest flaw to a hiring manager, learn the tactics that will help you consistently transform negatives into positives.

Let&#8217;s see if this situation rings any bells: You&#8217;re in the hot seat for an interview, and you&#8217;re doing well so farâ€”until the hiring manager throws you a curveball. It&#8217;s time for the dreaded interview questions about weakness.

Such interview questions, which ask you to talk about your personal shortcomings, are intended to expose your interpersonal skills and self-awareness. Employers want to recruit someone who is open about their flaws, can work well with others, and is dedicated to personal and professional growth.

Since the interviewer needs to measure your courage as well as if you accept responsibility or blame someone else, questions about vulnerability often highlight fear or strong emotion. Answer these questions frankly, diplomatically, and professionally by following these guidelines.

### **Don&#8217;t point the fingers**

As a way to explain your responses to interview questions about weakness, you might feel compelled to throw your manager or coworker under the bus. Don&#8217;t give in to the temptation. Accept responsibility for your mistakes, even though it&#8217;s true that you miss deadlines in part because someone in the art department is still late with his responses.

Conflicts and problems exist in almost every office setting, so the aim is to demonstrate that you can behave professionally rather than emotionally.

### **Be True To Yourself**

Employers should not seek candidates who have never made a mistake; they understand that no one is flawless. They want to see you as you really are. When you admit your faults and shortcomings, you become more relatable.

However, choose wisely which weakness to bring up during the interview. If something is at the heart of your career, don&#8217;t tell you&#8217;re bad at it. A salesperson, for example, should not confess to having trouble bonding with customers, and a Marketer should not admit to being bad using marketing tools.

### **Show a desire to change**

When you admit a weakness, you can also tell the interviewer how you handled a previous mistake and what lessons you learned for the future.

For example, if you missed a critical deadline and irritated your manager, clarify why you apologised to the manager, admitted your mistake to your boss, and devised a plan to improve your time management and organizational skills.
