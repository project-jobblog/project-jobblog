When working from home, does staying concentrated and efficient sound like a task? The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+pandemic&oq=COVID-19+pandemic) has forced us to work from home and it is not easy for all of us. What&#8217;s the way out then? When working from home, how can one remain concentrated and prevent distractions? Fortunately, there are some things still under our influence.

Here are a few suggestions for avoiding distractions and remaining active in the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak while working from home.

### Maintain a to-do list on a regular basis

The easiest way to get started is by making a priority list. This list will assist you to remain concentrated and efficient. All the appropriate tasks can be jotted down and numbered according to priority and feasibility. Take a note of the activities that are pending that require attention the following day after the day ends.

### Using a dedicated internet browser

Using a single dedicated web browser for work and maintaining a separate browser for personal web browsing is best. Our web browsers have tabs or websites/programmes much of the time that have little to do with our job. They interrupt and decrease our performance. If we want to get more out of our day at work, it&#8217;s important to remain focused.

### Create a dedicated workspace at home

The first move to a peaceful work environment at home may be the construction of a dedicated workspace. It can be difficult to save a place for your office files and vital stationery in a busy household, but to ensure that you work in a productive manner and finish your work on time, it is crucial to find the corner that works best for you.

### Work during office hours

For best performance, stick to your office routine. It may not fit for everybody, but you need to find your own sweet spot after that. If you are a morning person, it&#8217;s best to start early and call it a day based on your office timing. This will not only keep you on track and focused but will also help you maintain a healthy balance in your work life. Starting your day on time and completing it would help you spend more time with your family.

### Be connected with your team

Team contact can lead to increased success as it allows you to understand the goals of your team and how you can contribute. Speak to your team mates, talk about the tasks you are working on, ask for support or volunteer to help a team member if possible.

### Maintain your schedule for your office

It is necessary to plan your meeting schedule to be effective at work. Many professionals have to be present at customer meetings and it is important for you to have an impeccable work calendar linked to your email to be practically present at work from home. You have to handle not just the workplace schedule, but also fine-tune your household tasks in order to manage your personal and professional life effectively.

### Keep yourself encouraged

When working from home, it&#8217;s easy to get distracted, disillusioned and demotivated. So how are you going to stay in good spirits? In everything you do, always strive to make a difference. You will never feel demotivated if you take pride in your job. We are honored for the work we do. The secret is self-motivation. Speak to a colleague, find someone you can support, or volunteer for a project if you feel disillusioned. Work on something that provides you with pleasure and a sense of achievement.

### Take breaks periodically

We sometimes neglect to take short breaks while working from home. During the day it is important to take frequent breaks. One can make a rule to take a break every two hours to do this properly. Quick breaks keep you active and fresh.

It is the art of balance and self-control to work from home. The more you practice, the more of this craft you learn.
