It&#8217;s not difficult to avoid a job posting scam. It&#8217;s all about recognizing the telltale signs of a phony job offer.

### **The job opportunity appears to be too good to be true**

What if a company offers you a job with pay that appears to be excessively high for the position? Be cautious once more. Scammers will occasionally promise their victims a significant sum of money in exchange for personal information or money to send for &#8220;testing&#8221; materials. If a job offer appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. It most likely is.

### **A free email address is provided as contact information**

If the contact information on an online job offering is in the form of a Gmail or Yahoo account, be cautious. When posting job openings, legitimate businesses do not use free email services. Instead, they&#8217;ll send emails with their corporate names in the subject line.

### **Too much personal**

When you respond to a job posting, the individual who placed it asks for your Social Security number or birth information right away. Alternatively, the person may ask for your bank account details in order to set up a direct deposit. This information should never be shared. Before the [job offer](/things-to-consider-before-accepting-a-job-offer/) or conducting an in-person interview, legitimate organizations will not ask for personal information, especially such sensitive information.

Scammers, on the other hand, will. They&#8217;ll use this information to steal your identity and gain access to your bank and credit card accounts online.

### **You are being asked to pay**

Another red flag to look out for? A job posting scam asks you to send money to pay for training materials. If a poster asks for money to analyze your CV or to prepare an application, what should you do? Those are also red flags for a con. Prospective employees are never charged to apply for a job at a legitimate company.

### **They recruit you right away**

Receiving a job offer is always gratifying. But what if the offer arrives too soon? Take care. Before giving you a job offer, legitimate employers will want to interview you in person, or at the very least over the phone. What if a company makes you an offer after a quick email exchange? That&#8217;s a big red flag that they&#8217;re merely offering you a &#8220;job&#8221; so they can take your personal information afterward.

### **They got in touch with you**

If an email with a job opportunity shows unexpectedly in your inbox, be wary. The majority of respectable businesses will advertise job openings and then sort through the candidates that apply. They are not required to communicate with strangers on the internet. If you get a job offer from someone you&#8217;ve never met at a company you&#8217;ve never heard of, what should you do? It&#8217;s almost certainly a scam.
