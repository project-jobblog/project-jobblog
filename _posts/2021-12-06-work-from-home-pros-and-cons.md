The terms &#8220;[work from home](/category/work-from-home/)&#8221; and &#8220;remote working&#8221; are often used interchangeably. Despite the fact that they appear to be similar concepts, they are actually completely different. It&#8217;s crucial to understand the distinction since your boss might be perplexed by what you&#8217;re trying to negotiate and achieve.

When you work remotely, you can do your job from anywhere in the world. It necessitates a unique set of abilities and skills, and it isn&#8217;t appropriate for all job types &#8211; however, there are those that are best suited to remote working. Remote working necessitates the establishment of a home office, as well as great communication and teamwork abilities.

Working from home, on the other hand, is often defined as doing some or all of your work from your home or place of abode. For example, you might work in an office for the majority of the week yet finish your work at home on Friday. You still have the same structure and foundation as your office â€” you&#8217;re just substituting your home office for the company space.

Working from home is frequently intended to be a temporary solution, whereas remote working is completely another way of doing tasks. Working from home has become the &#8216;new normal&#8217; for many people as a result of the events of 2020. So, if you&#8217;ve discovered that remote working suits you better, you might want to talk to your boss about it.

### **Work from home has both Advantages and Disadvantages**

Now that we&#8217;ve looked at the advantages of working from home for your company, what about the advantages and disadvantages of working from home for you? It may appear to be a very enticing and desirable career choice, but it could either be a terrific or a terrible one based on your own particular work style and priorities.

### **Pros of Working from Home**

  * **Improved digital skills.** If you work from home, you will be more dependant on various pieces of technology, thus your digital skills will be greatly boosted.
  * **Increased adaptability.** Because you won&#8217;t have to commute, you&#8217;ll be able to work earlier in the mornings or later in the nights if necessary. You&#8217;ll be able to organize your personal life as well, such as doctor&#8217;s visits.
  * **More potential for collaboration.** Working from home, if you work for a company with offices and divisions all over the world, will allow you to interact creatively with these teams because you can adjust to time variations and other factors.
  * **A greater sense of self-sufficiency.** Working from home provides a great deal of autonomy and independence, which may be lacking at your office.
  * **Increased communication skills.** Working from home necessitates frequent communication with your coworkers and the supervisors to whom you report. As a result, your communication skill will substantially increase.

### **Cons of Working from Home**

  * **Increased isolation.** Working from home on a regular basis can contribute to feelings of loneliness. It is possible to avoid this by planning outings with friends and family.
  * **Disconnection from the company.** Working from home may make you feel disconnected from the company culture, and you may miss out on important information as it becomes available. This could make people feel disenfranchised.
  * **At-home distractions.** Distractions such as the television, dogs, or forgotten chores can all get in the way of your workday. Finding techniques to limit these can have a significant impact on your motivation and productivity.
  * **There&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;ll work too much.** Because you won&#8217;t have to go into the office every day, the working hours will become blurred, putting you at risk of burnout.
  * **Operating expenses for a home office.** Things like internet and electricity bills don&#8217;t effect you when you work in an office. They can sneak up on you when you work from home. You may also be needed to purchase a desk, chair, and monitor, all of which might be costly.

### **Final thoughts**

Working from home could be a perfect fit for you, particularly if you&#8217;ve discovered your groove in the last year. Employers will want to make the most of the rooms they&#8217;re renting as offices reopen, so they&#8217;ll want to make them worth the money.

Approaching your company and properly discussing your wish to work from home is critical, and it will necessitate many studies into why it would be a good fit for both them and you.

Even the bargaining process, at the end of the day, will demonstrate to your employer that you have creative thinking and a positive attitude on your position, so you&#8217;ll get confidence from it.
