After a holiday, going back to work is never easy, right? But it&#8217;s time to snap back to reality — swap those early morning sleep-ins, and put your office face on. Work is a-calling!

To go back to work, doesn&#8217;t have to feel like a chore. In fact, you can make your first day back really enjoyable by following a few pieces of advice. Here&#8217;s how you can make sure the transition is slightly less stressful from beaches to conference rooms.

### Show up on scheduled time

Coming back from a break late on your first day is probably one of the worst things you can do so figure it out! To ensure that you are not caught, prepare ahead for any traffic delays, and be on time. Nothing demonstrates disdain for your work or a lack of commitment other than failing to turn up on time.

### Start cracking on the calls and emails!

The hardest thing about taking a break is going back to a massive inbox that needs to be cleared. Don&#8217;t panic, offer priority to responding to the latest emails, i.e. the ones sent to you in the last 2-3 days. Put all the others in a separate folder to reply to later, and ensure that emails are given at least one hour per day. The hypothesis here is that someone who sent you an email two weeks ago should be able to wait — and if they can&#8217;t, chances are they&#8217;ve sent you an email again in the last 48 hours.

### Determine your priority targets

What is your most significant assignment? After the holidays, you may have a truckload of work to catch up on, but do not let it overtake you. On the first day back, there is absolutely no way you can get it all done. After reviewing them with your boss, take a moment, prioritize, and go to work on the most pressing tasks first.

### Talk to your coworkers

Yes, we know that you&#8217;re busy and need to get back to work, but on your first day, take a few moments to catch up with your colleagues. Ask them how their break was, share your own vacation stories, and re-establish a bond.

### Plan your first week back

It doesn&#8217;t mean it has to feel like a grind just because you&#8217;re back at work. Prioritize your social calendar after prioritizing your workload! Set up a few lunch dates and a couple of other catch-ups with friends &#8211; with colleagues or clients. **It&#8217;s important to have a good balance** because if it&#8217;s just work, work, work, you&#8217;ll probably feel like you need another holiday.

### Go home at a reasonable time

Don&#8217;t suck yourself into the stresses of presentism. It&#8217;s not going to help anybody to work until 10 pm on your first day back &#8211; you&#8217;re not going to be productive, and you&#8217;re just going to be exhausted for the next day. Alternatively, schedule your day well, work smart, and finish on time. To relax, go home, make a to-do list for the next day, and hit the hay! **_The idea is to remain safe at work_**.

On your first day back in the office, it may sound like a lot to do but it&#8217;s better to have a bit of a plan than run around like a headless chicken.
