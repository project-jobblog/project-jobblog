It is just for the unemployed to look for a career, right? You can and should continue to look for the perfect job, contrary to common opinion. It may seem counter-intuitive, but it is important for your professional success to search constantly, even if you never follow any of these leads.

There are some benefits of keeping an eye on the work market even though you are not actively pursuing a new career or job transition. Keeping an eye on the market never hurts. Nothing is worse, after all, than searching for a job when you&#8217;re desperate! So, never stop your quest for a job, because..

### You discover your prospective market value

Proactively applying for a position and interviewing other businesses gives you the ability to assess your present market value and enhance the skills employers are looking for. Most importantly, it shows you what you lack. You will go back to your current job with more confidence when you know what you&#8217;re worth, to show yourself and get what you want.

### To remain competitive, you should develop your skills.

Keeping tabs on the job market and setting career goals gives you a useful insight into how your current skill set aligns with the industry&#8217;s demands. You would have a leg up on other candidates when you actually make a decision to move on, many of whom may have waited until they were unemployed to start looking for new possibilities.

### You keep ahead of a sudden work market tragedy

There can be many explanations for why it is possible to place one in a difficult position. Due to market consolidation or a tough economy, for example, you might face redundancy. Often, you might get a new employer who doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re the best match for his squad. It can save you from not being left at the mercy of changing business preferences by obtaining a few options or even being actively available in the job market.

### You&#8217;re updating your CV

If you have been in the same position for too long, chances are your CV is obsolete and full of virtual cobwebs. If you may think there is no need to update your CV, especially when you&#8217;re not looking for a new gig, it just makes sense to tailor it every six months or so. For example, you can automatically mention it on your resume when you get a new assignment or achievement. With more and more businesses scanning resumes submitted electronically, it is crucial to make sure that your resume is correctly formatted and includes keywords that are searchable and appropriate.

### You get closer to your dream career by an inch

The only way to get closer to finding your ideal work is to continue pursuing your interests and maintaining a tab on your career aspirations, envisioning the big picture. It also helps you decide what you really want in your profession and you would have a clear contrast with other positions available in your field of the current experience.
