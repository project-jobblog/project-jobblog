Why Are You Looking for a New Job? It&#8217;s highly probable that your potential new employers may ask why you&#8217;re leaving your present job during an interview for a new one. The way you respond to this question will reveal a lot about who you are as a person and as an employee, so think about it carefully. Whatever the reason for your departure – you wanted more money, you were fired, you hate your boss – there is a way to phrase your response that will make you appear good. We&#8217;ve got some expert advice on how to approach this difficult topic.

 

### **Be Truthful**

Lying to a potential employer would almost always backfire, so be honest about why you&#8217;re leaving. Tell them if you&#8217;ve been laid off or are expecting to be laid off. The majority of businesses will recognize that staff changes are an unavoidable element of doing business. Similarly, telling the interviewer that you are considering leaving your present company due to changes in [toxic workplace culture](/common-signs-youre-in-a-toxic-work-environment/) or financial issues might show that you are ambitious and driven to progress your career.

### **Maintain a Positive Attitude**

Maintain a positive attitude in your responses, regardless of the circumstances surrounding your prior employment. Negative, accusatory responses come out as petty, and they make you appear tough to deal with. If the issue was a strained personal connection with your employer, state that your values did not coincide with those of the leadership. If you&#8217;re leaving a failing firm, focus on the absence of fresh prospects for you rather than the bad economy. If the issue is that you&#8217;ve reached a pay ceiling, that&#8217;s generally linked to promotions and responsibilities. Concentrate on the fact that your prospects for advancement are restricted, as well as your desire to take on additional tasks.

 
### **Be Tactful**

Sincerity is vital, but so is tact. If you&#8217;re leaving your job because you hate your boss, want more money, or have a better commute, frame your response in a way that highlights your strengths rather than making you appear like a greedy opportunist. Keep in mind that the interviewer is searching for ways you may offer value to the team while composing your response. &#8220;Does this make me sound like an arrogant employee?&#8221; ask yourself when you respond. Address your motive for moving employment, but do it in a way that demonstrates how your talents and worth may now be transferred to the new firm.

### **Keep it Short**

It&#8217;s like walking into a field of landmines if you delve into too much detail. Instead, keep your response concise by addressing the question briefly and then shifting the conversation to why you want this position and what you can do to the organization. Concentrating on the pull elements rather than the push aspects helps you appear to be a committed candidate. It will also assist you to avoid accidentally badmouthing your previous employer, which is something you never want to do in an interview. The greatest responses are those that say nothing bad and just express your genuine interest in the job or company for which you are interviewing.

 

It&#8217;s ideal to be prepared to answer a question regarding your reasons for leaving prior employment before heading into an interview, especially if you&#8217;re departing under difficult circumstances. When asked, &#8220;[How Do You Describe Yourself?](/interview-question-how-do-you-describe-yourself-in-one-sentence/)&#8221; remember to be honest, but not to the point of seeming arrogant, and to use your response to illustrate why you would be a productive and motivated employee.
