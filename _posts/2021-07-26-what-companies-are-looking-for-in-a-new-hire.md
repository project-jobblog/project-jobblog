We understand how hard it is to seek a new job. We&#8217;re not here to tell you it&#8217;ll be simple, but we can give you some pointers that might make it a little more bearable. When it comes down to it, when it comes to hiring a new employee, employers have similar expectations. It all boils down to abilities: are you capable of doing the job? Is it something you&#8217;re qualified for, and do you have any transferable skills? Do you agree with the company&#8217;s core values?

Finally, it&#8217;s what employers refer to as &#8220;cultural fit,&#8221; but I prefer to refer to it as &#8220;culture add.&#8221; Do you contribute to the company&#8217;s culture in any way? You will be more prepared while drafting your CV, cover letter, and/or application if you are aware of these criteria. Use these materials to demonstrate how and why you&#8217;re the best candidate for the job based on these requirements.

### **There is no &#8220;I&#8221; in the word &#8220;team.&#8221;**

Employers seek individuals who can form collaborative relationships and take pride in their ability to operate as part of a team. Instead of saying &#8220;I did it,&#8221; talk about a moment when you worked as part of a team to achieve a common goal. When it comes down to it, emphasizing your capacity to form solid professional relationships demonstrates to your potential employer that you&#8217;re someone they&#8217;d like to work with.

### **Accountability is essential**

A popular interview question is how you handled a challenging scenario in the past. Did you miss a crucial deadline at your previous job? Admit your error and discuss how you resolved the situation and what you learned as a result. Taking responsibility and being accountable when anything goes wrong is critical to your professional success. Integrity is also crucial, so if you say you&#8217;re going to do something, make sure you do it.

### **Tell your success**

Have you ever been asked, &#8220;Why should we hire you?&#8221; by a potential employer? You have 30 seconds to persuade the rest of the room that you are the best candidate for the job. How do you go about doing it? Know that now is not the time to be modest, but rather to confidently identify your personal and professional accomplishments. Tell us about a time when you overcame a difficult situation and came out on top. Tell us about that big project you worked on that either saved or made money for the company. Tell us about your newest family member, whether it&#8217;s a newborn or a pet.

### **Make a plan for your future**

Employees that know where they want to go professionally and what they want to accomplish along the road are sought after by companies. Your tenure with an employer could be merely a stepping stone in your career, or it could be a long-term partnership. In either case, an employer wants to see that you&#8217;re taking steps ahead with care and that you&#8217;re willing to learn new skills.
