It is a setback to take the wrong career direction, but it&#8217;s not an impossible setback from which to come back.

The key is to understand that you have made a wrong decision, to decide why it happened, and then to draw up a strategy to move forward.

You&#8217;re concerned about selecting the wrong profession, but aren&#8217;t you sure? Here are the signs you&#8217;ve a wrong career path:

### You don&#8217;t do well at your job

Job success is the most significant factor that decides one&#8217;s career development. Employees who find opportunities to save and make money for the business appear to achieve the most results and position themselves for a promotion.

But if you notice that your performance at work is steadily deteriorating and your employers are not pleased with you or if you can&#8217;t find ways to enhance your performance at work, or if you&#8217;re not excited about improving your performance, then it might be time for a job search and a career change.

### You have lots of anxiety or tension.

For almost anyone who works, stress and anxiety are normal. However, if one&#8217;s health problems are significantly impacted by a stressful work climate, he or she may want to consider a career change.

If you find your emotional peace at work is compromised by stress and anxiety, think that it might be the wrong career choice for you.

### You&#8217;re not satisfied with your job position

You can still feel overwhelmed with your job duties, even though you have senior status at work. Remember, one of the main factors behind building a good career is work satisfaction. You might try to have a career conversation with your manager to see if there are ways to change any of your duties if you are not happy with your job responsibilities.

If you go this path, however you need to bring some thoughts to the table about changing your job duties and how the business will benefit from it. You may not be on the right career path if you can&#8217;t do that, or are not excited about this opportunity.

### Your not enjoying your work

Typically, those who achieve career success find their work personally rewarding, and love to find ways to overcome the job&#8217;s challenges.

Remember, for different individuals, tastes are different and it would also be foolish to pick a job only because others have been good with it. What you have to do is choose a profession that suits your talent and abilities exactly. Don&#8217;t be pigeonholed into a particular profession only because you might end up unhappy or someone you know is happy with it.

### Choosing the wrong job career is not something you need to be ashamed of!

It happens to a lot of individuals. It&#8217;s important to learn from it like any mistake, and apply those lessons to your efforts to choose the right career.

What you should do is remain in a job in which you&#8217;re dissatisfied. It not only stunts the development of your profession, but it affects your employer negatively.
