Although social media is filled with humble-bragging, it is difficult for many individuals to speak in a face-to-face conversation about their performance. You want to show your very best side when going to a job interview, though, but you don&#8217;t want to show offâ€”and yet, you don&#8217;t want to be too modest.

What you need is something in between, but, particularly in an entirely unknown setting, the balance is difficult to find. Here are a few tips to help you get the right base to get your dream job done.

### Tell a Story

The meaning can also get lost when talking about your successes, which may result in you being viewed as a show-off. You should tell your performance in a tale to try to prevent this misunderstanding. You are more likely to persuade people that you are a successful worker, contextualizing your accomplishment with a challenge, method, solution, and outcome. Especially during job interviews, rather than just talking about outcomes, you should also demonstrate your thought.

Being able to speak in the form of a narrative about yourself and your successes is a wonderful skill to have. Not only is it helpful in job interviews, but it is also helpful in customer conversations, sales presentations, and team communications. You can get every point across once you learn how to build and tell a story.

### Do not reflect on yourself, but on your actions.

It&#8217;s very easy to get lost talking about yourself when being anxious in work interviews. But you could run the risk of finding yourself egocentric or narcissistic. We have to speak about our successes because of the essence of job interviews, so focusing on your deeds instead of yourself would help show you in the right light.

Instead of calling yourself a media professional, describe yourself as having had plenty of experience, working on the editorial direction and creative growth in both the print and online media industries. Instead of pointing directly at the solution, speak about your approach to a problem and how you have solved it.

### Be grateful for your success

It is okay to point out your successes if you speak about your past job experiences. You can, however, also express appreciation for your achievements. Know that you didn&#8217;t do it all alone, no matter what and how large your accomplishments are.

Make sure you mention your team, bosses, or anyone else who helped you reach your goals &#8211; that&#8217;s the truth, after all. Not only is it a humble and honourable thing to do, but it will also prove that your team and colleagues care for you. There is much more respect for an appreciative worker than someone who claims all the glory.

### Don&#8217;t reveal all at once during Job Interviews

Sharing your successes all at once, your discussion partner will quickly be distracted. **Bear in mind that not everything you have accomplished can be important**, appropriate, or suitable for sharing. Mind to whom you are listening. What is it that is of interest to them? If you&#8217;re in a mid-career job interview, sharing your success stories from your time at university may not be a good idea. The HR manager might wonder how important that is.

Strategically, share your success stories and make them work into the discussion. Don&#8217;t just brag about the first thing that comes to mind, but to make your point stick, share something important. You would most certainly have the reverse impact by wishing to impress with all your success stories and accomplishments.
