When job interviewers ask how you cope with annoying coworkers, it may sound like a question from an online dating profile, but they&#8217;re trying to figure out how you&#8217;ll get along with your coworkers and customers, as well as how your personality can fit in with the company culture. Unfortunately, you won&#8217;t be able to absolutely stop annoyances.

Consider it for a moment. Almost every organization has at least one employee who types like a hammer. Who is a chatterbox, for example? Or who is excruciatingly perky and chirpy at all hours of the day and night. And who has constant phone fights with their significant other loud enough for the whole floor to hear?

Coworkers that annoy you are unavoidable. They don&#8217;t mean any harm, but they can drive you insane, making your job much more difficult than it needs to be. Nonetheless, you must persevere and complete your work. Interviewers want to know that you won&#8217;t let anything as minor as a noisy chewer derail your work.

Hiring managers are attempting to determine whether you are easily annoyed, adaptable, and a good match for their business.

Doesn&#8217;t that make sense? But, if you don&#8217;t want to answer this question by ranting about any irritating trait you&#8217;ve noticed in others, you&#8217;ll need to prepare ahead of time. Use the suggestions below to narrow down your answer to something that won&#8217;t turn off a potential employer.

### **When dealing with an annoyance, show patience**

You must show that you can deal with annoying coworkers in a cool and constructive manner. Nobody likes a whiner who does little to improve the situation.

Most interviewers ask this question to see if you&#8217;re a constructive, solution-oriented person, which is code for a good communicator. It&#8217;s crucial not to be too cruel or too eager to satisfy others.

Yelling or berating others, no matter how irritating they are, is both disrespectful and unhelpful. Instead, when there&#8217;s a disagreement, it&#8217;s best to clarify how you listen to someone. Give a response that demonstrates you prefer to talk about your irritations with others and find a common ground, rather than remaining irritated or going to your supervisor to complain without first trying to resolve the problem yourself.

### **Show that you are not bothered with small things**

Personal pet peeves vary from legitimate grievances; in the grand scheme of things, someone who bites their nails is less of a problem than someone who fails every single deadline set for them. Employers do not want to hire people who would be annoyed by minor details, so you must react in a way that demonstrates that minor details will not bother you.

Working with others is challenging, but people who are easily irritated or difficult to get along with cause more problems down the road.

You just don&#8217;t want to come off as someone who can&#8217;t deal with people who think differently than you. Avoid making people think you&#8217;re impatient or don&#8217;t understand them.

Maybe you are most productive in the mornings, but your coworker is most productive in the afternoons. The team should not be derailed as a result of this. You must adapt to various working types, or you will become the annoyance.

### **Be Upfront What Irritates You**

Consider the variety of personalities that can be found in a single workplace. People that are annoying come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Remember that everyone is irritated by something, and as job demands increase, these irritations will start to impede teamwork and productivity.

Don&#8217;t lie to the interviewer and say there are no forms of people who irritate you. Even the most patient person will become irritated with coworkers at some stage, so you&#8217;ll need to explain a time when you were genuinely upset at work.

### **You&#8217;re not done yet**

It&#8217;s not easy to get along with obnoxious and annoying coworkers, but you don&#8217;t have a choice in the workplace if you want to keep your job. Showing hiring managers that you&#8217;re pleasant, even when dealing with irritants, is a good start, and you&#8217;ll want your other responses to back up that argument.
