Nursing Resume: How to Write an Entry-Level Resume? Nurses in their mid-career and advanced years have a variety of job experience and clinical expertise to develop an appealing résumé. Nursing job applicants, on the other hand, may not be able to let their work speak for itself at the start of their careers.

It might be difficult to write an effective entry-level nursing resume, but with the proper tools, the right format, and the right direction, you can build the CV that hiring managers are searching for.

Begin by following these easy-to-follow guidelines for developing an entry-level nursing resume.

With a functional format, you can concentrate on your skills and talents rather than your practical on-the-job experience. This format was created with new graduates in mind, as well as mid-career career transitions.

 

### **Nursing Job Titles to Think About**

You recognize that not all nursing positions are the same as a recent nursing program graduate in need of an entry-level nursing resume. Candidates with very specialized talents and expertise are required for various tasks. You can handle this in your entry-level nursing resume by focusing on the precise career you want and researching the most relevant abilities and experience that companies look for.

 

Here are a few nurse career titles to think about:

### **Clinic Nurse**

A clinic nurse (also known as a clinical nurse) is a nurse who specializes in advanced nursing. A master&#8217;s degree in nursing is required for this position, as well as several years of specialized training in fields such as emergency care, pediatrics, or geriatrics.

Clinical nurses can serve as primary care practitioners, but they don&#8217;t usually make as much as physicians (medical school graduates), therefore they&#8217;re in high demand, especially in budget-conscious hospitals and rural areas. Clinical nurses&#8217; advanced competence normally necessitates a costly education, but this investment usually pays off, and clinical nurses rarely go unemployed for long periods of time.

 

### **Obstetric and Gynecology Nurse**

OB-Gyn nurses (obstetrics and gynecology nurses) specialize in the care of pregnant women and women with reproductive system problems. These nurses are registered nurses (RNs), which implies they have completed an associate&#8217;s or bachelor&#8217;s degree program and have met all of the state&#8217;s licensure criteria.

OB-Gyn nurses are responsible for preparing patients for procedures, monitoring their progress, administering medications, collaborating with a healthcare team, maintaining patient records, and a variety of other activities linked to pregnancy and childbirth. This is a relatively high-paying and in-demand position, though demand and salary will differ by region.

 
### **Oncology Nurse**

An oncology nurse is a professional that gives medical and emotional support to cancer patients of all types. This position normally necessitates the completion of an associate&#8217;s or bachelor&#8217;s degree program in order to become an RN, as well as graduate-level oncology nursing training.

This role requires nurses to deliver cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, monitor patient progress, keep records, and collaborate with a cancer care team that may include surgeons and radiologists. This position, like any other in nursing, can be psychologically, physically, and emotionally demanding, yet demand and pay are slightly greater than the national average for RNs.

 

### **Charge Nurse**

Charge nurses typically hold a supervisory position and are in charge of an entire department within their clinic or healthcare facility. Nurses must be willing to add a leadership component to their existing clinical skill sets in order to take on this role.

While some charge nurses have their own patient load, their primary responsibility is to supervise, review, schedule, evaluate, and supervise the nurses and healthcare support employees under their supervision. This is normally not an entry-level position, but as your nursing career progresses, you can aim for this position.

### **Office Nurse**

Under the supervision of registered nurses or physicians, licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses (sometimes known as office nurses) offer basic care. Jobseekers must complete a state-approved program, which often involves a licensing exam and takes roughly a year to complete from start to finish.

Hospitals, schools, clinics, residential facilities, and private residences are all places where office nurses work. The average salary for this position is [around $45,000](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/posting/office-nurse-salary), and working conditions might be difficult. What&#8217;s the good news? The need for this employment is increasing, with available positions predicted to grow by around 12% by 2026.

### **Basic Sections of a Nursing Resume for Entry-Level Positions**

Some healthcare resumes do not follow the typical resume structure outlined here (if you&#8217;re looking for a job as a physician or dentist, visit our website for further information). These five standard components will, nevertheless, be included in an efficient entry-level nursing resume. Make sure your paper has at least these sections, and feel free to add more if you like.

  * **Relevant experience:** What if you don&#8217;t have any on-the-job experience? It&#8217;s no problem. Workplace experience isn&#8217;t the only source of relevant experience. Have you ever volunteered or finished a clinical training program or internship? Have you finished a nurse practitioner residency or shadowed one? Employers value all of these, as well as the hands-on work you did as part of your degree program.
  * **Education:** List each of your programs, diplomas, or certificates of completion, as well as the institutions that awarded them, on your resume. This section should also include licensing information.
  * **Heading:** At the top of the page, your nursing resume should have a clear heading that includes your name, contact information, and website links (optional). On a modern nursing CV, your home address isn&#8217;t required.
  * \*\*Professional summary: \*\* Add roughly three or four lines of text under your headline that summarize your most important qualifications for the job. If you don&#8217;t have a lot of experience, use this area to explain why you want to do this job, what your strongest abilities are, or what your finest academic and extracurricular achievements are.
  * **Skills:** As a trained and qualified nurse, you&#8217;ve gathered a wealth of clinical, therapeutic, software, leadership, and client-engagement skills, regardless of your level of experience. This section of your resume should be highlighted because it is the most likely to make you stand out.
