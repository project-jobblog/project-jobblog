Your first day at work is as taxing as the job search process that precedes it when it comes to experiencing anxiety and excitement. You are likely to be a bundle of nerves on your first day, stepping into an unknown setting. Your first day of work, both memorable and frustrating, is all about meeting your new colleagues and boss, familiarizing yourself with the new work process, etc.

When you are focusing on making a lasting first impression, your confidence can easily be played on by the anticipation of what is to come next.

### Have a prepared pitch

Questions like &#8216;why did you quit your former job?&#8217; are most likely going to be posed. &#8216;, or&#8217; What are your weaknesses and strengths? It is best to be ready with your answers before your first day at work to avoid awkwardness and be vague with your responses.

### Showcase your soft-skills

Although you are hired for your technical abilities, it is also important to have full knowledge of soft skills. If you work with seniors, peers or customers, it is a surefire way to please them all by exhibiting impeccable soft skills. Alongside the technical skills, aim to implement the following soft skills:

  * Adaptability
  * Positivity
  * Learning from criticism
  * Working under tight deadlines
  * Communication
  * Creativity
  * Problem-solving
  * Collaboration

### Observe and be proactive

It is certain that joining a new workplace will leave you with plenty of questions. It is good to demonstrate a curiosity to learn, and you can do so by having prepared a list of questions. Taking initiatives and demonstrating that you are eager to learn is also what will come in handy. Ensure that the questions that you ask are more in-depth at your orientation meeting.

### Don&#8217;t forget to unwind

The first day at work is typically more mentally stressful. Therefore, taking short breaks and relaxing are essential. This is the best way for your productivity to be optimized. Some of the other important things to keep in mind before your first day at work are to be well rested the night before you start at your new place of work, to prepare for your first day and to reach the office on time.

### Show up early on

The aim is to arrive at least 15 minutes early, but not sooner. You&#8217;re not going to want to come across as too eager. On your first day, leaving early for the office will help you avoid rush hours.

### Be prepared to start work, the first day itself

This is right. On the first day itself, there is a high probability that your boss may assign you a task. Be ready from day one to start work.

### Observe your office&#8217;s social landscape

A good way of determining the positional hierarchy in your organization is to figure out the social landscape.

### Keep professionalism intact

While it is fine to take short breaks and relax, don&#8217;t overdo it. Dress professionally and be as polite as you were during the process of your interview. Be mindful of the fact that by overdoing the jokes, you do not send out a wrong message. The concept is to help your colleagues to be as comfortable as possible when they are around you.

### Pay attention to your body language

We send out non-verbal messages with our body language, apart from verbal contact. In a professional set up, body language makes up for much of the contact. So, through your body language, decide what you are projecting and how others can view you. Make required alterations if necessary. Stop doing as follows:

  * The body turned away from a person you are speaking to
  * Maintaining minimal to no eye contact
  * Arms folded in front of the body
  * Minimal or tense facial expression

You are guaranteed to survive the first day at work with ease with these tips. So, go ahead and make a terrific [first-day impression](/how-to-make-a-great-impression-at-work/).
