The resignation of an employee is rarely a time for celebration. When someone resigns, it&#8217;s natural to have shocked, furious, or surprised reactions. The employee is someone you trust, in whom you&#8217;ve invested in training and development, and who adds value to the companyâ€”and they&#8217;ve informed you that they&#8217;re leaving.

For managers, each person is a significant member of the team, and you will miss them even if they are not long-term employees or senior employees. When they go, they take their experience, talents, and general knowledge with them. But don&#8217;t take it too seriously.

People leave jobs for a number of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. Your employee may have found a better-paying position, decided to change industries, or simply realized that there isn&#8217;t enough opportunity for them to advance in the company.

The show must, nevertheless, go on. You, the manager, will have an easier time responding to and processing an employee&#8217;s leave if your team has sound practices and open communication, as this article demonstrates.

 
### **Inquire and dig deeper**

If you have an open and honest working relationship with your employee, talk to them and try to understand why they are leaving from their perspective. Although it may be difficult not to be wounded, it is important to view this as a &#8220;**pure business**&#8221; decision.

Learn why they&#8217;re leaving for greener pastures. Are there any important lessons to be learned? Perhaps you have some serious issues that need to be addressed right now. If your leadership or management style is the problem, use this as an opportunity to grow as a manager who understands their own flaws.

 

### **Maintain your composure.**

It&#8217;s normal to question if your employee is leaving due to your actions. Try to ignore everything. Don&#8217;t make it about you; instead, concentrate on the genuine problem.

[People switch jobs](/typical-reasons-why-people-switching-jobs/). They receive better offers or are enticed to make a life change. Make an effort not to become defensive. Remember that, whatever the reason, it is the best option for them, and they are doing what will make them happy in life and at work. Maintain your composure and engage in a good discussion about their plans.

 
### **Fill in the productivity gap**

The transition plan for their daily responsibilities should be considered when determining how and when to notify the resignation with the rest of the team and other key stakeholders. Inquire about the employee&#8217;s current projects and upcoming deadlines in the employee&#8217;s transition documentation. Find out who in the team is best prepared to take on pending duties and get advice from them. Create development plans and a succession plan as well so that the team does not face the same issue again.

### **Take an alternative approach to things.**

Consider whether there are any things you&#8217;d do differently the next time. Consider ways to improve your workplace and take a step back. Introspection will help you grow and learn, and you should always be prepared for any form of resignation.

Increase the number of talks you have with your staff about career options. You&#8217;ll gain a better grasp of where your employees want to go if you spend honest one-on-one time with them about their goals. As a result, you&#8217;ll be better able to prepare for the future of your team and talent.
 

### **Bid farewell to the employee.**

Everyone, especially in the job, wants to be recognized and appreciated. It is critical that we offer three magic words to the departing employee as a manager: congratulations, goodbye, and thanks. Keep in mind that your coworkers will be watching how you manage your resignation.

Make a point of thanking them in front of their coworkers and explaining why they were so successful in their position. Express your gratitude to the employee for the opportunity to meet and work with them. Thank the individual for their contributions to the company and provide your best wishes for their future endeavors.

### **Keep going.**

When one door shuts, a new one opens. Consider resignations as a fresh start, an opportunity to rethink the job description of the position they&#8217;re leaving behind. This would also be a good opportunity to grant a well-deserved promotion to one of the team&#8217;s surviving members. Maintain a positive attitude and tell your employees that they are all important. Reiterate the significance of their jobs as well as the compelling reasons for their presence.

It&#8217;s difficult to deal with resignations, especially when they involve a key employee. It is not necessary, however, to aggravate the issue. Keep in mind that no one is irreplaceable. The manager also sets the tone for what follows the resignation. This tone has repercussions for employees&#8217; immediate and long-term futures across the company.
