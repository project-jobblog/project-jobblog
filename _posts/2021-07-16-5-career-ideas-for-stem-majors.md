After graduation, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) majors have a wide range of career opportunities, both in STEM and non-STEM sectors. Fortunately, graduates with degrees in science, engineering, technology, or mathematics have a bright job outlook. Over the next 10 years, STEM jobs are expected to grow at a rate more than double that of non-STEM jobs, and STEM jobs pay much more than non-STEM ones. This isn&#8217;t surprising, given that many STEM careers necessitate substantial training and education.

STEM majors&#8217; professions may not have to be in STEM-related industries or roles. A STEM degree can also help you succeed in other areas like education and business. If you&#8217;re not sure what you want to do after graduation, here are STEM-related career options to consider.

### **Sales Representative**

Just because you majored in a STEM degree doesn&#8217;t imply you have to pursue a career in science or mathematics. In fact, your STEM background may make you a good fit for a sales role. Having technical abilities will offer you an advantage at many organizations because a great seller knows their product inside and out.

Some technical or scientific sales positions, particularly in the medical area, will necessitate a STEM degree. Medical sales jobs require backgrounds in biology, chemistry, or physics, whereas technical sales positions require majors in computer science or engineering. STEM majors are likely to succeed in SaaS, telecommunications, or hardware sales, all of which benefit from a technical background.



### **Tech Consultant**

A career as a technology consultant could be ideal for you if you enjoy dealing with both technology and people. Clients often hire technology consultants to assist them to address business problems and improve their technology usage. To work with clients, you&#8217;ll need both technical talents to tackle difficult challenges and business acumen and customer service skills.

Depending on the organization and business unit you work for, you could be conducting technical accessibility studies, producing technical documentation, designing custom apps, querying datasets, preparing client presentations, or any number of other similar jobs on any given day. This can be the right profession for you if you majored in computer science, mathematics, management information systems, or a related discipline.


### **Data Analyst/Scientist**

Do you like to solve complex problems and are fascinated by numbers? Then data science could be a good fit for you. As more businesses rely on technology and seek to make data-driven choices, the demand for data scientists is expanding. Because of the great demand for the profession, as well as the high compensation and levels of employee [job satisfaction](/the-importance-of-job-satisfaction/).

Because data scientists are needed in practically every industry, you&#8217;ll be able to work for companies that share your interests and values. While a degree in data science is ideal, having a background in any of the STEM subjects, such as mathematics, computer science, statistics, or economics, will also help you succeed in this sector.

### **Software Engineer**

One of the most sought-after STEM jobs is software engineering. Every industry and company of any size requires software engineers. Websites, computer games, operating systems, computer programs, and more can all be developed by software developers. The possibilities are truly limitless, giving you the opportunity to chart your own career path. Students who majored in computer science, software development, or computer engineering are the most likely to apply for these positions.



### **Mechanical Engineer**

Mechanical engineers have a significant impact on our daily lives. Mechanical engineers built or developed almost every process or machine we use, from microwaves to cars to medical equipment. You&#8217;ll have the chance to make a meaningful difference in people&#8217;s lives as a mechanical engineer. You&#8217;ll also have the option of working in a variety of industries, such as automotive, pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, or energy.

Mechanical engineers, unlike some of the other positions on this list that are open to a range of majors, require specialized training in the subject. To work in mechanical engineering, you&#8217;ll likely require a degree in mechanical, electrical, or another related engineering subject.
