When you&#8217;re looking for a job, you&#8217;re constantly bombarded with data or scams. Positions can seem appealing, but are they real?

We have this feeling because we were in the same boat when we first started looking for work. We discovered some easy solutions through our research that will dramatically reduce the risk of falling victim to jobe scams.

Here are several methods for locating legitimate work that aren&#8217;t scams.

### **Start with a Google search**

Take your time to thoroughly study the organization or [job market](/job-search-tips-in-an-uncertain-job-market/) opportunity. A Google search is a quick and easy way to do this. Someone could have written a negative review if they had a bad experience with the business. Look around to see what you can find, both good and bad. The fastest results can be found by searching for the company&#8217;s name and the keywords &#8220;job scams&#8221; or &#8220;analysis.&#8221; Make sure you look through the first page of search results, as bad feedback can often get buried.

### **Did you submit an application for the position?**

When people are looking for work, they often apply for several positions at different companies. However, if you don&#8217;t keep track of your efforts, you run the risk of falling victim to job scams. Many scammers will send unsolicited job offers via email or phone. If you don&#8217;t keep track of your efforts, you may think it&#8217;s a legitimate organization making a legitimate job offer, but you&#8217;ve unwittingly fallen for a con.

You can use a spreadsheet to monitor your work applications and schedule, track, coordinate, and manage your entire job quest. You&#8217;ll be able to stop job scams and keep track of important dates if you use this method. Whatever method you choose, make sure you don&#8217;t miss this crucial move!

Recruiters may contact you out of the blue, but these are positions for highly qualified professionals such as nursing or engineering. Engineering, distribution, logistics, publicity, and HR are the most sought-after job roles. Recruiters seldom hire for entry-level positions because there are plenty of people qualified to fill them.

### **Visit These Website**

Investigate and study the companies you&#8217;re interested in using the websites mentioned below. You can find a lot of informations on these websites.

  * **WAHM.com (a website dedicated to working mothers) &#8211;** If someone has been let down by a work offer, they have most likely shared their story on WAHM.com. This website has the largest career platform on the internet. You may either check for threads about the business you want to work for or start your own discussions to learn more about it.
  * **The Better Business Bureau (BBB)**  **&#8211;** Investigate the company on the Better Business Bureau website to see if there is any favorable or negative feedback. Some businesses claim to be BBB members and display a BBB membership logo on their website. Don&#8217;t just assume they&#8217;re a member; try clicking on the logo; it should take you to their BBB summary and ranking. If not, conduct a manual search on the BBB website using the company&#8217;s name, URL, phone number, or email address. Visit [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/)

### **Are they backed up by social proof?**

Are there any testimonials from former customers or staff on the company&#8217;s website? Make an effort to contact these individuals to obtain their candid opinions on the organization or program. Has the business been mentioned in the press or in a well-known publication? If their website says &#8220;**as seen on**,&#8221; try clicking on the logo; it should take you to the article or media event. If not, try a manual Google search with the business name and media source to see if the article can be found.

When a business is featured in a major media outlet, it is usually something they are proud of, and they can link directly to the feature in order to improve their reputation. If the business is on Facebook, look for customer feedback and ratings on the left-hand side of their website.

### **Are they making a lot of claims that aren&#8217;t true?**

Have you ever seen a job posting that advertised ridiculously high pay for entry-level work? What about **job openings** where you can start right away and don&#8217;t need any prior experience? I can assure you that the application, interview, and recruiting process for legitimate jobs takes a fair amount of time; normally weeks, if not months.

Furthermore, legitimate jobs would not pay excessive salaries for entry-level positions because there are more than enough applicants to fill these positions. If you&#8217;re not sure if a pay rate is fair, go to **PayScale.com** and look up the average salary for the job you&#8217;re applying for in your region.

### **Are they visible to the general public?**

People who promote job scams do not want to be discovered. Names, headshots, business histories and biographies, active social media accounts, and contact details are all things to look for.

Scammers tend to hide behind fake phone numbers, PO boxes, and enigmatic online accounts; try contacting them to learn more about their business or opportunity.

If a President or Founder&#8217;s name is listed on their website, look them up on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) to see if their data matches. This should be a red flag sign to you if they aren&#8217;t publicly available.

### **How do you feel in your gut?**

Have you completed all of the previous steps and everything seems to be in order? But something about it doesn&#8217;t sound quite right? Always go for your instinct! Intuition is a natural phenomenon that allows you to know something is wrong even though you don&#8217;t have any evidence.
