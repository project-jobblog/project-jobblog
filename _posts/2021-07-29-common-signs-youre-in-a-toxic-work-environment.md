Common Signs You&#8217;re in a Toxic Work Environment. Teams that are productive, joyful, and engaged have one thing in common: they operate in a pleasant, supportive, and healthy environment. Toxic work environments? They do appear to be a little different. Gossip, conflict, and poor communication are all too common in bad circumstances. So, how can you determine if toxicity is a problem at your company? Keep an eye out for warning signs of a toxic work environment and find out what you can do about it.

### **Characteristics of a Toxic Workplace**

No business owner wants to work in a harmful environment. It may result in:

  * Misunderstandings
  * Missed possibilities for growth
  * Employee turnover is high.
  * A smudge on one&#8217;s reputation

Toxic workplaces all have a few things in common. But if you know what to look for in a toxic work environment, you can halt them in their tracks before they do serious damage to your reputation. Here are toxic workplace warning signals to be aware of, as well as what you can do about them.

### **Turnover among employees is at an all-time high**

If staff seem to be dropping like flies, there&#8217;s probably a reason for that. High employee turnover may also be a result of workplace toxicity in specific situations. In fact, one out of every five employees has left their job because of a toxic work environment.

If your staff turnover rate is increasing, do some research to figure out why. Maybe it&#8217;s because of low pay or benefits, a lack of [work-life balance](/category/work-life-balance/), or limited prospects for advancement.

During an exit interview, ask questions to learn why employees are leaving. That way, you can pinpoint issues and determine whether high turnover is due to a hostile work environment.

Make some observations around your job if you aren&#8217;t getting any answers through departure interviews. Are your coworkers getting along? Is it okay for your team to ask you questions? To guarantee that toxicity is not the core reason for excessive employee turnover, pay attention and listen to your team.

### **Ineffective Communication**

When it comes to running a business, communication is crucial. However, if you and your team don&#8217;t know how to interact with one another, things can soon become poisonous.

Take a glance around to see whether you have bad communication. Consider the following questions:

  * Do you and your team have mutual trust?
  * Is there a lot of conflict?
  * How do employees interact with one another?
  * Do you communicate effectively with your coworkers?

You should also consider other issues such as project communication, time management, and priority alignment.

### **Gossip is unrestricted**

Gossipy conduct, cliques, and exclusion are all signs of a toxic work environment. You may have a poor work environment if you find gossip spreading easily around your company and becoming a pattern.

So, how can you determine if your workplace is becoming toxic and gossip is out of hand? Keep a lookout for the following:

  * Aggressive passive-aggressive statements
  * An increase in workplace tension and drama
  * Whispering
  * Unfavorable body language

Gossiping can create not only upset feelings but can also lower staff morale and force workers to leave your company.

Unfortunately, office gossip is impossible to prevent entirely. In fact, [55 percent of men and 79 percent of women](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/a-surprising-new-workplace-study-reveals-who-real-gossipers-are-men-or-women.html) admit to office chatting. Sometimes it&#8217;s impossible to avoid it entirely. You can, however, discourage it and crush it at an early stage. Be alert, lead by example, and consider establishing and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy at your company to help reduce gossip culture.

### **A Lack of Motivation**

Another sign that your workplace is toxic is a lack of motivation among your coworkers. If your team doesn&#8217;t seem motivated, it&#8217;s possible that a bad work atmosphere is to blame.

So, how do you tell whether or not your team is motivated? Keep an eye out for:

  * Work quality has deteriorated
  * A rise in absences
  * A shift in mindset
  * Inability to concentrate

Remember that just because your team isn&#8217;t motivated doesn&#8217;t mean your environment is unhealthy. However, it never hurts to double-check that it isn&#8217;t toxic and to take action if it is.

Make sure your staff is on the same page as you when it comes to your company&#8217;s objective and vision. Set clear objectives for your team so they have something to aim for. Also, remember to commend and thank the staff for a job well done on both large and minor jobs. A little gratitude goes a long way.

### **Minimal or No Growth**

You want your staff to thrive and prosper as a business owner. They can then use their newfound skills and knowledge to help your firm succeed. But, lack of employee progress is another red flag of a bad workplace.

So, how is your company performing in terms of expansion? Are you suffocating your company&#8217;s potential for growth? Are you encouraging them, or are you discouraging them? You may be cultivating a toxic environment if you don&#8217;t give your staff the opportunity to grow and don&#8217;t invest in extending their prospects.

You may help employees grow at work by:

  * Provide employees with training sessions
  * Inquire about employees&#8217; career aspirations.
  * Provide staff with resources
  * Provide educational support
  * Make expansion plans
  * Work with employees as mentors

The more you can do to assist your team in developing and succeeding, the better. Employee growth also equals more growth for your business, so it&#8217;s a win-win situation.
