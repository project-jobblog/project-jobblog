Is your CV up to date or have many mistakes? The digital landscape has completely transformed the recruitment industry over the years. And it&#8217;s easy to fall behind as a job seeker.

There are a lot of things to consider if you want to succeed in this age, whether it&#8217;s not including certain terms or unintentionally raising a few red flags by choosing a certain structure!

So, without further ado, here we go.

Here are some top tips for avoiding common CV mistakes and creating the perfect CV to ensure you look current in 2021.

### **Listing political preferences**

Personally, I believe this is one of the most common CV mistakes. Politics is a highly subjective field.

Any affiliations you have should not be listed on your CV as they may irritate someone and take up more space in the process.

The only exception is if you are applying for a position within a political party. You&#8217;re setting yourself up for a big fall if you don&#8217;t.

### **Including an excessive number of bullet points**

While bullet points are a great way to clearly outline your accomplishments and skills, using them too frequently can be detrimental. Having more than five bullet points in one section may give the impression that you&#8217;re trying too hard to appear qualified for the position.

Instead, keep the content to three or four lines.

### **Inefficiency of white spaces**

It&#8217;s one thing to keep your CV to a maximum of two pages. However, cramming as much text as possible into those pages can result in a cluttered and unclear appearance.

A good CV should have plenty of white space around the document&#8217;s perimeter and separating each section.

This makes your CV look cleaner, more professional, and easier to read for the employer.

### **There is no personal branding**

Branding is a term used to describe a company&#8217;s image to its target audience.

Personal branding, on the other hand, is critical in writing a great CV because it helps convey what you stand for, your expertise, and your thoughts on workplace culture.

Creating a personal brand persona will assist you in selling yourself more effectively.

### **Leaving out social media accounts**

You should be aware that before offering you an interview, all employers will conduct a search of your social media profiles. So, why make it difficult for them to find?

It is critical to include links to all of your social media accounts.  
Indeed, including a YouTube channel can greatly aid in the sale of your personal brand.

The employer or recruiter can get to know you informally and appreciate your interests outside of work.

If you intend to include links to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) accounts, make sure your social media profiles are clean before submitting your application. It&#8217;s a great idea; CV mistakes pale in comparison to sloppy social media accounts.

### **Lack of flow**

While personality, keywords, and including the appropriate number of bullet points are important, don&#8217;t forget to address the flow of your [resume](/category/resume-tips/).

Using too many colloquial phrases or adding too much &#8220;fluff&#8221; will make it appear unprofessional. Don&#8217;t ramble; instead, be concise, informative, and relevant.

### **Including your contact information**

In many cases, including your street address in your CV is no longer necessary. It&#8217;s out of date, pointless, and, to be honest, a waste of space.

Remember to follow the two-page rule while leaving plenty of white space. So, removing your address will undoubtedly free up some space.

The most important information to remember is your name, phone number, email address, and links to your social media accounts, particularly LinkedIn.

### **Lack of character**

It&#8217;s the year 2021! It is very much appreciated if you can show some personality and creativity. Don&#8217;t get me wrong: maintaining a high level of professionalism is critical.

There is, however, a time and place to add some personality to your CV. It could be as simple as showcasing your personal brand.

This can be accomplished by including a brand statement at the top of your CV or by using specific words that show you understand the meaning of a playful, yet professional tone of voice. If you believe you will struggle with this, you should think about hiring a CV writer.
