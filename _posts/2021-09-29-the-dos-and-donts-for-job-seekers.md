The Dos and Don’ts for Job Seekers! You&#8217;ve finished your degree! Of course, this deserves a round of applause and a pat on the back, but it also signals that it&#8217;s time to start serious about job seeking. Just when you thought you were finally free from all of your studies&#8217; hard work, the idea of finding a job presents itself—and you may not know where to begin your search.

But don&#8217;t worry—this isn&#8217;t another story about [Generation Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z)&#8216;s [uphill battle in today&#8217;s job market](/job-search-tips-in-an-uncertain-job-market/). This is a step-by-step guide to the dos and don&#8217;ts of your first job search, along with all the advice you&#8217;ll need to land a genuinely fantastic position.


### **The DOS of your first job search**



### **Create a strong résumé**

First and foremost, your résumé. Perhaps you&#8217;ve already put together a working résumé for positions you&#8217;ve applied for while in college, which you can utilize as a starting point. If you&#8217;re staring at a blank Word document, though, you might want to see the [different types of resumes](/types-of-resume-format-you-should-know/) and other tools to improve your chances of crafting a superb résumé right now. With so many other graduates looking for work, you want to stand out. Make sure your résumé is clear, succinct, and free of flaws that could taint how a recruiter perceives you.

### **Come up with a unique cover letter**

You should also write an attention-getting cover letter if it&#8217;s acceptable for your field. A cover letter serves as a personalized introduction to your résumé. They should explain why you&#8217;re applying, why you want to work for their organization, and what you can bring to the table to the recruiter. You can learn more about what to include in a cover letter on our blog, as well as step-by-step instructions on how to write a great cover letter.

### **If you lack experience, consider an internship**

While it may seem absurd to pursue an internship after earning a bachelor&#8217;s degree, some internships can pave the door for a better chance later on. Even if you&#8217;ve done multiple internships in college, you might not have the necessary experience to secure a competitive position.

For example, if you find what appears to be the perfect job for you but it&#8217;s a manager&#8217;s role, you might want to contact the company and ask about an internship instead. Who knows, maybe they&#8217;ll regard your initiative as a positive sign and give you a chance. The most important thing is to pursue something you truly desire, and internships are a terrific way to get your foot in the door.

### **The DONTS of your first job search**



### **Send out impersonal, bulk emails**

It&#8217;s time to revisit your résumé and cover letter after you&#8217;ve picked a few positions you&#8217;d like to apply for. You might be thinking, &#8220;but Yes, you did, and now it&#8217;s time to improve them. Every single one of your materials, including your résumé, cover letter, and application email, should be tailored to the organization in question.

It&#8217;s a big no-no to send the same generic email to five or six different job positions! The recruiter will immediately see through your time-saving scheme and will be more likely to dismiss your application.

Of course, if the employment post requires a form-based application, you won&#8217;t need to send an email. The most important conclusion here is that all items in your initial communication with the organization, regardless of style, should be personalized—that is, they should speak to one specific individual about one specific function at one unique company.

### **Use cute language in your initial interactions**

It&#8217;s natural to want to display your personality in your job application when trying to be original and stick out from the crowd. There is, however, a time and a place for letting your personality shine, and it isn&#8217;t in your first conversations with the recruiter. Save the eccentricity for your first brainstorming session after you&#8217;ve been hired.

Recruiters are quickly turned off by casual communication approaches. In an initial email or application, you never want to come out as overly informal. You&#8217;d like to be taken seriously, right? Keep things short and professional by using professional language and titles.

### **Waste time looking for jobs that are well outside your skill set**

One last piece of advice for your first job search is to concentrate on open positions that match your present skill level. Fabricating your application and lying about your degree of experience is a definite method to land yourself in an embarrassing interview.

Rather than squandering your (and the recruiter&#8217;s) time, limit your search to jobs that match your skillset. You should be proud of your abilities! Being a recent graduate means you have a lot to offer, from fresh insights to technological expertise. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with an [entry-level job](/tips-on-how-to-find-entry-level-job/); in fact, you&#8217;ll probably learn more in one than you ever imagined imaginable, and it&#8217;ll establish the foundation for a rewarding career.
