The payoff is here: a work offer after sending out carefully designed cover letters and resumes and carrying out several rounds of job interviews. Time for a celebration? Not so quickly.

Even in a difficult job market, taking the first job offer you get isn&#8217;t necessarily in your best interest. And what if you are faced with more than one attractive alternative? You may have been lucky enough to score several job opportunities or you may have one offer in hand and another (or more) chance that looks good but is still in the stage of the interview.

This is a nice issue to have, but all the same, a dilemma. Prioritizing what is most important to you and determining how the deal at hand aligns with your top priorities and your other current choices is important.

Here are some suggestions for assessing and making a smart decision on the work offer.

### The Money Question

You are very lucky if money is not the main problem for you. Many individuals, however, find that their financial situation greatly affects their decision-making in their careers.

Finances must be weighed in two crucial ways when deciding whether to accept a job offer:

**Could you afford an uninspiring bid to pass up and wait for anything better?** 

It might be appropriate to compromise on waiting for your dream work if you have been between gigs for a while, and consider something that will help you pay the bills right now. You might also be more likely to accept a less favorable compensation package if finances are tight, as any cash flow is better than zero.

That isn&#8217;t to suggest it&#8217;s right or fair. You can only determine if it is appropriate to prioritize earning money immediately over the other variables mentioned below.

**How does the proposed payout compare with the other options?** 

You must also assume, for any job offer, whether the pay offered is fair and attractive. It&#8217;s about your quality of life and feeling respected as an employee, not just about the numbers on your paycheck.

Note that salary is just one aspect of the pay equation. You will need to take into account health insurance, paid time off, 401(k), and other variables. From the first bid, there might also be space to negotiate, either for more money or for additional benefits.

In order to ensure that the offer is realistic based on industry averages and the level of experience, look at wage analysis on [Payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose). When you want to try to negotiate a better deal, this research will also give you some ammo.

Then, if you accept the job, do the calculations to make sure you understand how much you will be able to survive. Before accepting an offer that seems unreasonable (no one wants to be a bargain hire and it could later trigger resentment) or could lead to financial difficulty down the road, think long and hard.

At the same time, if the work is a bad match in other important ways, don&#8217;t allow yourself to be swayed by a big paycheck. When it helps people to shift from poverty to around $50,000 per year can money improve happiness

### The Job

Naturally, for the near future, you would still want to evaluate the job itself and the work you will be doing for 8+ hours a day.

* Are there any considerations about the quality of life to consider? Think about commute time, overtime planned, opportunities for flexibility, and related factors.
* Is it important to have recognition, leadership, an awesome title for you? And, to what degree do these items give the position?
* Are you excited about thinking about the job?
* Does the job encourage you to use the abilities that you enjoy most? How frequently?
* Do you trust the business and its services? Do you have a passion for making a contribution?
* What position in the company are you going to play? How are you going to connect with coworkers?

### Company Management

Before you meet the manager, some positions look fantastic on paper. A great manager can make a difficult job satisfying, but even a dream job can be frustrating for a poor manager.

The most influence on your day-to-day work life would be your direct manager.

* What is his style of leadership and how does it fit in with your preferences?
* Does he seem fair in his expectations?
* Is he anyone with whom you should work?
* Is he showing loyalty to the members of his team?
* In the business, does he have a strong reputation?

### The Job Culture

When you work there, it can be hard to get a true understanding of the culture of an organization. However, you can get a pretty good idea of how they work if you try for clues and ask good [questions during the final rounds of interviews](/what-to-expect-in-a-final-job-interview/). You will also benefit a great deal by searching out former company workers in your network.

**Some questions about culture to consider:** 

* Is preparation, mobility, and promotion from within emphasized by the company?
* What kind of personalities seem to be flourishing?
* Do you see yourself functioning in that setting after leaving the office?
* Are the principles of the business in line with yours?
* Do business leaders prioritize topics that you consider important?

### Future Prospects

No place is forever in today&#8217;s job market. You must decide how it will position you for the future with each action you take.

* Does the job provide you with a &#8220;foot in the door&#8221; to make a career change that you want?
* Would you have access to valuable resources for training and networking?
* Is this job going to keep you sharp?
* Will the day-to-day duties encourage you to build skills that in the future will make you even more marketable?
* Does this position entail increased liability?
* Can working at this organization give added credibility to your resume?

All five of the categories above should be considered when deciding whether to accept a job offer. However, according to personal meaning, you must also prioritize. Right now, compensation may be your main concern, or maybe you need a more creative culture after years in a staid business.

Think about which topics are important to you and where you&#8217;d be able to make sacrifices. Although the decision can be challenging, it can help lead you to the job that was meant for you by providing a simple list of goals and specific answers.
