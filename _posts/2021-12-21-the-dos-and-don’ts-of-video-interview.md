Video interview is here to stay, whether you like them or not. You must know what to do and how to do it if you apply for a job and are requested to participate in a video interview. This is some recommendations for a successful video interview are listed below.

<br/><br/>

## **The Dos of Video Interview**

<br/><br/>

### **Check your background with some practice recordings**

Because interviewers are aware that you are most likely[ working from home](/category/work-from-home/), don’t be concerned about having personal items in the backdrop. However, make sure you’re aware of your past and whether it implies the messaging and brand you want to convey. If at all possible, try to keep the number of items in the backdrop to a minimum. As a result, the interviewer will be able to concentrate more on their core subject—you!

<br/><br/>

### **Make sure your microphone is in good working order**

Although video interview software should notify you of this and make it easy to determine whether or not the sound is working, you should at least record yourself and listen to the audio to ensure that it is clear.

### **Determine how you’ll begin and end each response**

Don’t begin with a long “uuuuuum,” and don’t conclude with “well, yes, I suppose that’s it.” Prepare some response introductions and conclusions in advance, and rehearse them until they seem natural.

<br/><br/>

### **Directly respond to each question**

Make sure you answer each question they pose so they don’t come away thinking, “Um, he didn’t even answer the question; she just rambled on.”

<br/><br/>

### **Dress as if you’re going to an onsite interview**

You’ll be on camera, so this should be a no-brainer. You should dress as professionally as you would for an onsite interview. Also, keep in mind that you don’t want the interviewer to see you in a dress shirt and tie if you need to get up or walk away for a second during the interview. . . bottoms of pajamas Dress for the interview from head to toe.

### **Make sure you’re in a good mood**

You might want to position your camera or laptop such that you can stand up while using it. Make an effort to smile and maintain a cheerful attitude. The interviewers want to see your enthusiasm and enthusiasm. Practice answering inquiries while smiling and displaying attention if you’re like me and have a face that shows you’re deep in thinking.

## **The Dont’s of Video Interview**

<br/><br/>

### **Remember to prepare for frequent interview questions**

Research some of the most common interview questions and prepare responses to them. Don’t forget to do some research on frequent interview questions in your sector. Also, prepare a list of questions to ask your interviewer. Prepare questions to ask on both fronts by researching the firm and, of course, the role.

### **Don’t forget to keep an eye on yourself**

Pre-interview, check your hair, teeth, and any other visuals for optimal presentation. You don’t want to be known for your bedhead or that stuff in your teeth that might have been flossed out.

### **Don’t lose sight of what you’re doing**

Don’t glance down or away from a scripted response you’ve written on paper. In fact, don’t scribble any answers or use a cue card! You don’t get to cheat just because this is a video interview. Consider a video interview to be the same as an onsite interview—the only difference is that you’re not sitting in the HR department of a corporation.

### **Don’t forget to follow-up**

Just because you did an out-of-the-box interview doesn’t mean you’re not responsible for the follow-up. Thank the interviewers for the opportunity in an email, and perhaps provide a thought about something that came up after the interview.

## **Last Thoughts**

The dos and don’ts of video interviews are essentially the same as those of onsite interviews. The only difference is that you’re telling a camera about all of your skills and knowledge. It can be strange at first; you should absolutely perform some dry runs on camera before the interview to get used to being on camera.

Also, do everything you can to distinguish yourself apart from the other interviewees: conduct the interview in a quiet environment, be prepared, communicate clearly and effectively, keep eye contact with the camera, and be prepared.
