Resume icons were all the rage a few years ago. Why type out your phone number when you can draw a pretty little phone sign instead? Icons are the trademark of today&#8217;s personality-filled resume.

But does this imply that you should put them on your resume? And, if you do decide to put them somewhere, where should you put them? This blog will delve into the specifics of where to find resume icons and how to use them on your resume.

### **Is it appropriate to include icons on your resume?**

If you&#8217;re confident that the firm will enjoy a little individuality, you can put more unique icons to each talent, such as a pencil next to &#8220;Drafting&#8221; or a muffin if you&#8217;re a weekend pastry chef.

* **&#8220;Employment History&#8221; and &#8220;Education&#8221; are samples of section headings**

### **Vector or png icons for resumes**
