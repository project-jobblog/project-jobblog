The thank-you note of the job seeker determines their chances of securing the job. &#8220;***Does receiving a thank-you email/note affect the decision-making process after interviewing a candidate?***&#8220;. According to hiring managers, it matters. In reality, almost one in five interviewers dismissed a candidate completely because they did not receive more than one.

Not all job seekers, however, are heeding this warning. After an interview, nearly one-third of all professionals surveyed do not send a thank-you email or message, and a whopping seven percent say they never send thank-you notes after an interview.

You&#8217;re losing your chances of landing the job if you&#8217;re not sending a proper post-interview thank-you message.

Don&#8217;t forget this easy yet critical part of the method of the interview. Using the following tips to give an interview thank-you note that not only follows up on your candidacy but also separates you from the competition and brings you one step closer to accepting the [job offer](/category/job-offer/).

### ***Using this chance to overcome objections***

If the interviewer has expressed concern about recruiting you, in your thank-you letter, answer it head-on. Explain why you are willing to prove what it takes. Often, reiterate how your talents and expertise are directly related to the needs of the hiring manager. If during the actual [interview you failed](/things-that-can-ruin-your-job-interview/) to bring up an essential qualification, see if there&#8217;s a way to be smooth.

### ***Timing matters when giving thank you letter***

Send follow-up messages about your interview within 24 hours of the interview. Often, before leaving the building, ask each of your interviewers for a business card or check the spelling of the name of the person and their email address. If you know you have failed to do this, immediately reach your key contact point at the company and ask for the details so that you can submit a proper thank-you note.

### ***Customize each follow-up of the interview with little information***

Give each interviewer a personalized message that reflects your sincere interest in the opportunity for the job and reiterates your qualifications. Take note of what the individual loves most about your experience when you&#8217;re in the interview, so you can illustrate those selling points in your follow-up letter.

In your thank-you letter, also use the little information you learned about the interviewer, such as a **shared interest or a hobby**, to show your attention to detail and make your follow-up more memorable.

### ***Before following up, consider the culture of the company***

Although email is the most common way to send a thank you post-interview, there are some occasions where the hiring manager will earn you brownie points with a snail mail thank-you letter. For instance, if you have interviewed a highly conservative organization that prides itself on tradition, consider sending in addition to your email a handwritten thank-you card. This will not only cover the bases, but the handwritten note will arrive a day or two after your email, helping to once again catch the attention of the hiring manager.

### ***Send every interviewer a thank-you note***

If you have encountered numerous people during your company interview, be prepared to compose several thank-you notes afterward. **Avoid sending each person a generic &#8220;thank you,&#8221;** as certain businesses would require that all thank-you messages be forwarded to HR so that they can be attached to the file. The last thing you want is to compare thank-you notes with your interviewers and remember that you have given everybody a generic template. If you&#8217;re going to take the time to send thank-you notes for the interview, make them count.

### ***Do not write a book***

Use your follow-up post-interview message to thank the interviewer for their time, highlight your conversation&#8217;s key points, answer any questions raised by the interviewer regarding your candidacy, and reaffirm your interest in the job. Do not regurgitate your entire resume, just hold your message **long enough to cover the above-mentioned points**.
