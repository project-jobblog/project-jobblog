Wait, there are different types of resume? Yes, of course. In fact, there are three different sorts of resumes: chronological, functional, and a blend of the two. Let&#8217;s go over the basics of each kind and look at a specific example.

### **Functional Resume**

A functional resume, also known as a skills resume, is appropriate for those with little or no experience, such as recent graduates or those [making a career change](/how-to-changing-career-without-losing-your-mind-or-yourself/). A chronological resume is not a suitable choice for a teacher who suddenly decides to quit his job and start working as a content writer because he has very little to say about his work history. Instead, he can be considered a respectable candidate by showing all of the required qualities for the job opportunity.

This resume format emphasizes your skills and knowledge. Its content is organized around the key [skills needed for the job](/why-do-hard-skills-matter/). Of course, you must do your studies in order to build a persuasive functional resume: Read the job description attentively to determine what the companies are looking for in a candidate.

**The benefits and drawbacks of a functional resume**

The honesty and straightforwardness of functional resumes distinguishes them from other sorts of resumes. It&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re trying to initiate a direct conversation with the recruiter about what you&#8217;re capable of and how it qualifies you for the job.

Many employers, on the other hand, dislike this resume format since it takes them longer to screen out a candidate. They must evaluate the content in a whole different perspective than scanning through how many years of experience you have. Furthermore, it gives the idea that you are attempting to compensate for your lack of job experience, despite the fact that the value of work experience cannot be overstated.

### **Chronological Resume**

This resume format is ideal for people who have a long work history that revolves around a single job. It highlights your professional development and briefly identifies your current level. If you are a recent graduate with limited experience, however, this is not the best option for you.

This resume prioritizes your work history over your skills and lists them in reverse chronological order, beginning with your most recent position. Your work experience will usually be listed in a section that includes your job title, the company name, your start and end dates, and your primary responsibilities. The education section could come before or after the job experience section, depending on your preference.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chronological-Resume-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Types of resume : Chronological Resume" class="wp-image-703" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chronological-Resume-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chronological-Resume-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chronological-Resume-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chronological-Resume-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Chronological-Resume.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</div>

There are also some pointers that can help you get the most out of your chronological resume, as well as other types of resume:

  * **State your purpose clearly at the top of your resume:** This shows employers where you want to go and where you are now on your journey. Furthermore, having a defined goal in mind allows you to organize your work history in a way that reinforces your determination.
  * **Don&#8217;t just mention all of your responsibilities and tasks:** Instead, strive to generalize your responsibilities so that readers can see how your job affects the whole company. This is known as abstraction, which is a mental process in which general patterns are created from the use and classification of concrete examples.
  * **Mention some of your other qualifications:** Your employment history isn&#8217;t the sole thing that defines your career. As a result, you can also point to your accomplishments, recommendations from past companies, or a portfolio of your previous work.



### **Combination of the two : Functional and Chronological Resume**

You address the relevance of abilities and work experience equally in this format. Actually, you frequently separate out the talents you&#8217;ve acquired while working for a given firm. This is by far the most prevalent of all resume formats. Here are few examples from CV Simply&#8217;s library:

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combination-resume-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Types of resume : Functional and Chronological Resume" class="wp-image-702" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combination-resume-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combination-resume-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combination-resume-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combination-resume-768x769.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/06/combination-resume.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</div>



### **Are there any other resume options?**

Yes, they do exist. Curriculum vitae, or CV, is a format that is frequently confused with resume and is also used interchangeably with resume. In reality, these are two distinct types of resume documents.

College instructors and medics, for example, all require a specific format for this type of employment application information. If you work in these specialist fields, you may be aware of it.

You may also be required to include a portfolio of your prior work in the cover email if you are an artist, copywriter, advertising expert, architect, or designer.
