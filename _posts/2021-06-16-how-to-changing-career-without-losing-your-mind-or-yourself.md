While your friends and family may scoff and openly question your sanity, Changing your career is uncommon. While the conventional line you&#8217;ll hear is that most individuals change jobs five to ten times in their life, there&#8217;s solace in knowing that you&#8217;re far from alone.

However, if you&#8217;re going to changing your career, do it properly. This isn&#8217;t like purchasing a new pair of shoes; it&#8217;s a significant life change. Keep an eye on your step.

**Here are things to think about while changing career.**

### **Do Your Research Before Making a Career Change**

If you were moving to a new city, you&#8217;d conduct study, right? You&#8217;d read about which neighborhoods to avoid, where to find the nearest store, and which street that are dangerous to walk at night.

You&#8217;ll want to do the same for your future job, especially if you&#8217;re not sure what you&#8217;re going to do next—you just know you have to do something. Get the inside scoop on the industries you&#8217;re interested in like income growth, hiring trends, and the most in-demand talents.

### **Give yourself plenty of time to consider changing careers**

Bring your inner psychoanalyst out to play. If you have a comfortable couch, now is the time to use it. What is it that is truly causing you to be unhappy? Is it possible that you&#8217;re uninterested at work? That your employer irritates you to no end? Or is it just a bad month for you?

Make sure you&#8217;re certain—absolutely certain—that you&#8217;re changing career for the appropriate reasons before you make the decision.

**The following are examples of incorrect reasons:**

  * The commute is excessively long.
  * Your benefits are terrible.
  * Your [coworkers are toxic](/how-to-handle-annoying-and-obnoxious-coworkers/).

**The following are acceptable justifications:**

  * Your priorities in life have shifted.
  * You chose your profession by chance, merely because it was convenient at the time.
  * Your business is on the decline.

If self-interrogation reveals that any of the latter is driving your decision, don&#8217;t go all out and burn it down just yet. Simply look for a new job

### **Consider the Benefits and Drawbacks of Returning to School**

Student debt is a nightmare. Maybe it&#8217;s already following you about like an enraged ghost—maybe it&#8217;s why you&#8217;re looking for a new job in the first place. While some jobs do necessitate an advanced or specialized degree , others do not. So, before you spend the money to go back to school, consider long and hard about whether the career you want genuinely demands it.

Are you unsure? Continue to network. Most people will tell you if they believe the long-term benefits of an advanced degree will exceed the immediate financial hardship, and if it isn&#8217;t a requirement of your field, it might not be worth it.

### **Salary isn&#8217;t the most important factor**

We&#8217;re not suggesting that you disregard salary entirely while considering a career change. Running the figures doesn&#8217;t imply you&#8217;re money-hungry—it just means you&#8217;re really if you&#8217;re in a low-paying industry and the work isn&#8217;t keeping the lights on.

Making the error of choosing a new career only on the basis of its earning potential rather than how well it suits your interests, values, or capabilities would be a mistake. Finally, while your salary may play a role in your dissatisfaction, it is unlikely to be the only factor.

Consider the big picture: [work-life balance](/category/work-life-balance/), career advancement, and the role itself. You&#8217;re no better off than you were before you changed careers if you&#8217;re well-paid but unhappy.

### **Don&#8217;t Give Up Too Soon**

Okay, this one is self-evident. Don&#8217;t quit your job until you&#8217;ve secured another. No matter how desperate you are, no matter how much you despise your job and want to jump into the nearest anything, you&#8217;ll be taking a great risk if no one is there to toss you a life preserver when you reach deep water.

It&#8217;s one thing to look for a new employment. Changing careers is a different story. This could require some serious time and effort, and being confronted with a massive CV gap won&#8217;t help matters.

### **Get in touch with Your Network**

So you&#8217;ve done your homework, lurked in the shadows of a dozen business job boards, and memorized a dictionary&#8217;s worth of newfangled business lingo. But, let&#8217;s be honest, your idea of what your new job would entail is still largely speculative.

While it&#8217;s tempting to dismiss the value of networking , you&#8217;d be mistaken. Your best resource is other people.

Do you want a clear picture of what lies ahead? Use social media to put your talents to the test—message people who have the kind of job you desire and ask for an informational interview to see whether it&#8217;s a good fit. You&#8217;ll not only get a feeling of the types of questions that might be asked in a real interview, but you&#8217;ll also create some potentially useful contacts.

And, hey, if you create a good impression, they could consider calling you if a new position at their company becomes available.

### **Reorganize Your Resume**

There are no two jobs that are the same. So, why do you submit the same resume every time you apply for a job? Consider yourself in an interview situation: Would you give the same responses if you were applying for a graphic designer or a Food Delivery Rider? It&#8217;s unlikely. You&#8217;re doing yourself a disservice by phoning it in, as tempting as it is to perform a quick copy-paste of the same résumé you&#8217;ve been using for years.

This isn&#8217;t rocket science, but it will require some effort from you. Examine the job openings in your chosen field. What are the skills they&#8217;re seeking for? What kind of credentials do they usually demand?

We&#8217;re not suggesting you start over with your resume, but you should adapt it to highlight the skills that are most relevant to the position. This is especially vital when shifting to a new field, even if you have years of job experience.
