### **Be someone that others want to collaborate with**

If you&#8217;ve landed the role, remember to &#8220;treat people well.&#8221; There will be more opportunities.”

### **Anticipate — and prevent — predictable issues**

The trick to making your client&#8217;s life simpler is to prevent issues from occurring in the future. As a result, be clear about your requirements and goals from the start.

That may mean rescheduling the project to best meet your needs, negotiating a more fair rate, or changing the nature of the project. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t put off having those conversations. It&#8217;s always preferable to get something on the table ahead of time.

### **Understand the client&#8217;s true desires**

What are the true desires of employers? It&#8217;s an age-old issue when it comes to freelancing.

Clients expect freelancers to complete an assignment, such as making marketing tools, writing a blog post, drafting a press release, or creating a social media calendar. Clients, on the other hand, are looking for something more meaningful and less concrete. They want us to make it easier for them. They want us to fix problems rather than add to them.

### **Even if you&#8217;re not on-site, be &#8220;present&#8221;**

A great freelancer is someone who can be **&#8220;there&#8221;** even though they are not on-site or part of the regular team.

It&#8217;s all about communication; they&#8217;re great at keeping you informed, picking up the phone, and recognizing when they need to leave their cave and come into the office for a face-to-face conversation.

### **Recognize the value of daily or regular communication**

It&#8217;s true: communication is the glue that keeps the freelancer/client relationship together.

That means going above and above sending an email that states, &#8220;Here is the job you requested.&#8221; It entails always reacting promptly, checking in when the client has gone silent, and recommending in-person meetings when necessary. It also entails going out of your way to understand their needs and improve your relationship with them, such as asking questions about the company as a whole, learning about your client&#8217;s position within the company, and suggesting new ways to assist them in achieving their objectives.

### **Go above and beyond**

Of course, do the job you were hired to do, but go above and beyond. Make meaningful connections with your team, show them how happy you are to be a part of it, and establish yourself as indispensable. Remember that the opinions of your coworkers are just as important as the opinions of the person who hired you.

Freelancers must demonstrate their worth a little more; if you aren&#8217;t doing your work, the corporation will not hesitate to cut the fat. It&#8217;s all part of the game to establish rapport and gain respect.

In the freelance world, you&#8217;re up against a lot of people who are just as creative as you are. It&#8217;s important that you distinguish yourself. You&#8217;ll be the freelancer everyone wants to recruit if you make your employer&#8217;s life easier.
