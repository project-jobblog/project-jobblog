At work, mental health is a true epidemic. In reality, it affects 1 in 6.8 people at some point in their lives, accounting for 12.7 percent of all sick days. Mental health at work issues, when left undiagnosed and untreated, can lead to unemployment and low productivity.

There are a variety of reasons why you may be experiencing mental health problems at work, including:

  * High expectations for yourself and for the role you&#8217;re in.

<ul>
  <li>
    Uncertainty about your job and persistent questions about your output
  </li>
  <li>
    You are not being rewarded for your efforts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Too much effort and a failure to recognize the signs of mental illness
  </li>
  <li>
    A strained relationship with coworkers and superiors
  </li>
</ul>

If you&#8217;re experiencing any of the warning signs of mental illness, you should seek help right away before the situation worsens.

**Here are a few top tips to help you improve your mental health**

### **Communicate with&nbsp;a coworker**

Confiding in a close colleague is one of the better ways to tell others about your mental health. You will feel less lonely as a result of communication and interpersonal relationships.

Reaching out to a coworker isn&#8217;t a sign of weakness; it&#8217;s a sign of courage. Venting and voicing your frustrations will sometimes help clear your mind and make you feel much better.

Don&#8217;t be shocked if your coworker is having the same problems, as often people unconsciously bottle up their emotions.

### **Build great habits**

Adopting everyday routines of events and specific tasks will help to plan your day. Your mind can become familiar and relaxed with your routine by simply watering the plants in your office or making a cup of coffee at the same time every day.

If you want to challenge your mind, completing a crossword or Sudoku puzzle during your drive to work is another excellent choice.

### **Continue to be involved**

Feel-good endorphins are released when you stay involved and exercise, making you feel better. Go for a run first thing in the morning.

If you&#8217;re not a morning person, organizing yoga or other lunchtime workout groups is a great option. This is a good idea for the boss because it encourages well-being, teamwork, and can be a perk of the job. For both sides, it&#8217;s a win-win situation.

### **Consume alcohol in moderation**

Although an occasional beer or glass of wine is always enjoyable, don&#8217;t overindulge. Alcohol may have a negative effect on your mood and trigger anxiety.

Try something soft instead of an alcoholic beverage at a work party. If you want a similar taste, fruit-based drinks, non-alcoholic beer, or even drinking tonic without the gin are all good options.

### **Help Others**

Helping your coworkers finish a job, it turns out, will help with mental illness. The joy of helping others benefits your brain and gives you a sense of self-worth.

It doesn&#8217;t even have to be about work. Simply complimenting a coworker will brighten their day and put a smile on their face.

### **Take a pause**

When you start to feel stressed, anxious, or angry, get out of the situation and take a break. Do whatever works for you, whether it&#8217;s brewing a cup of tea or just going outside for a breath of fresh air.

If you work 6 hours or more a day, US law notes that [you have the right to a 20-minute](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/breaks) uninterrupted rest break during the day.

It&#8217;s suggested that if you&#8217;re stuck in front of a computer all day, you take a 10-minute break every hour.

### **Speak with your employer**

It&#8217;s not the end of the world if you tell your boss about your mental health issue. They can&#8217;t fire you, and they shouldn&#8217;t make your life difficult.

**Consider the following:**

  * **How much information you want to share** – you don&#8217;t have to share any of your personal information if you don&#8217;t want to. Instead, concentrate on how your mental health affects your career.
  * **Who you can tell** – informing an HR representative and your boss is not the same as informing your coworkers or other business associates. They are confident in their ability to provide you with assistance.
  * **How and when you&#8217;ll do it** – getting a doctor&#8217;s note will make it easier to clarify your condition, and doing it during a calm time of the day is preferable to doing so early in the morning or later in the evening.

### **Final Thoughts**

When it comes to mental health at work, the most important thing to consider is to speak up. It&#8217;s a subject that companies from all over the world are dealing with on a daily basis. But you aren&#8217;t all isolated.

Share your feelings with a trusted colleague and the appropriate manager; they may just be able to help you reduce the symptoms and get you back on track.
