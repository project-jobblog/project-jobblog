Have you ever had a bad day at work where maintaining your sanity was the greatest challenge? It may be a faulty printer or a coworker who stole your idea that sends you over the edge, but it&#8217;s important to handle the annoyances of a poor job environment professionally, even though steam is billowing from your ears.

**When irritants start to heat up, follow these tips to maintain your cool.**

### **Empathy is important**

Take a moment to put yourself in the shoes of the person who is irritating you, whether it is a coworker or a client. Keep in mind that you&#8217;re not the only one who&#8217;s having a bad day. Be the one to give someone else a break, just as you wish you could be given some slack now and then.

Everyone wants to be heard, so give them your full attention before responding. Recognize that their annoyances are being taken seriously. You might be shocked by how powerful it is at dissipating stress.

### **Don’t Fly Off the Handle**

Remember that you have no power over what other people do or say that irritates you, but you do have control over how you respond to those irritants. Maintaining perspective is an important aspect of remaining calm. All seems to be worse than it is in the heat of the moment.

Allow rationality and lead the way to help you calm down after a stressful day at work. Check to see if you&#8217;re reacting with the right amount of anger. You really don&#8217;t need to burst your bubble over a phone with a dead battery or a misplaced shoe. It&#8217;s easier to regulate your feelings if you&#8217;re conscious of them.

### **Irritations and chatter can be blocked out**

If environmental stressors are getting on your nerves, you just have one choice: block them out. Close your door if you have one, go outside for some fresh air, take a break from your desk, or put on your headphones to relax.

Practice zoning out in addition to physically blocking the irritations. Consider the positive aspects of your life, or assign yourself a menial duty to keep yourself occupied. Taking out the garbage, for example, will give you a sense of achievement while still giving your brain a break.

### **Master the Blowoff Technique**

The blowoff strategy is similar to gracefully exiting a conversation, with the exception that you participate as little as humanly possible. Send them the slip if the office feels dysfunctional, with coworkers or clients trying to pull you into a gossip fest. “Oh, you don&#8217;t say?” is all it takes. “Well, I&#8217;ve got to get back to work,” for example, can be very successful. This will help you position yourself as someone who doesn&#8217;t want to be concerned by workplace gossip or such discussions.

### **Clean Slate at the End of the Day**

Keep in mind that you work to live, not to live to work. Leave work at work and, if at all necessary, settle unresolved disputes by the end of the day. This allows you to mentally refresh overnight and start fresh the next day.

Make a list of all the things you intend to do the next day at the end of the day. You won&#8217;t have to carry your work brain home with you this way.

### **Break the Cycle of Negative Emotions**

Moods, whether positive or negative, are contagious, so do your part to prevent the spread of infectious negativity. You don&#8217;t have to sympathize with a coworker or supervisor who is having a tough day at work by echoing their bad mood. Make every effort to cheer them up. You never know how a few kind words will turn someone&#8217;s bad work day into a better one.

### **Make use of humour as a tool**

Never underestimate the strength of office hilarity. Take advantage of every opportunity to lighten the mood, even if it&#8217;s only private. Finding the humorous side of a bad situation will help to relieve a lot of stress. Just remember to maintain your professional demeanor. If you have to say, &#8220;I was just kidding!&#8221; after your joke, it was obviously not received well.

### **When a Bad Workday Doesn&#8217;t Go Anywhere**

It&#8217;s a red flag if you have more sanity-testing days at work than non-sanity-testing days. It shouldn&#8217;t feel like your work is punishing you. Do you need assistance in your quest for a new one?
