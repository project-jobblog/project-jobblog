The best method to grow and land the next job is to learn from previous experiences. Requesting feedback from a recruiter or interviewer might offer you useful information, but getting a response isn&#8217;t always straightforward.

### **Why Do Employers Refuse to Provide Feedback?**

After being rejected throughout the screening and interviewing process, [nearly 70% of candidates received no feedback](https://cdn-static.findly.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1232/2020/06/2018_NAM-CandE-Research-Report_FINAL_2619.pdf). 77 percent of those who did receive feedback believed it was useless.

Although there are a variety of reasons for a less than helpful (or completely absent!) response, such as a lack of time or a desire not to upset candidates, one of the most pressing concerns for employers is legal considerations. Attorneys are concerned that any comments may be used as the basis for a discrimination case, therefore they frequently counsel businesses to withhold information.

A lack of reaction from an employer is disappointing for a job seeker who wants to learn from their experiences. It&#8217;s only normal to ponder what you may have done better to attain a different result after realizing you didn&#8217;t receive the job after an interview.

As you continue your job search, reaching out to the employer and [thanking them](/thank-you-note-after-a-job-interview/) (again) for the interview opportunity and asking a brief question or two for feedback can be quite beneficial.

## **Questions to Consider in the Future**

While you may be tempted to ask why you weren&#8217;t hired, you&#8217;ll have more success if you ask specific questions about your performance.

**Here are some examples of possible questions:**

### _**Do you have any comments or suggestions on my resume or cover letter?**_

Writing a compelling CV and a [winning cover letter](/how-to-write-a-winning-cover-letter/) is a challenge for many job seekers. The feedback you receive on these two items could help you become a far stronger candidate for your next employment chance. If the recruiter or hiring manager points out mistakes, lack of originality, or customisation in your documents, you&#8217;ll have the chance to remedy them before applying for another job.

### **Could you give me pieces of advice for any future applications?**

Make it easy on interviewers to increase your chances of getting a response to your query. This question &#8220;shifts the focus away from a critique of the job applicant&#8217;s specific previous performance and toward general, forward-thinking suggestions that the employer may be more ready to supply.&#8221;

Also, because this question is so wide, you could get feedback on anything from a concern about a specific response you gave to nervousness getting the best of you or even a poor performance on a practice work exam.

### **Is there anything I&#8217;m missing in terms of relevant skills or experience?**

If you think you aced the interview but didn&#8217;t get the job, this question might help you figure out if someone with more experience got the job instead of you. Consider how you can increase your prospects for the next job application if the recruiter says you lack specific abilities or years of experience. You can build the abilities you need with the help of an online course, supplementary certification, or related volunteer experience.

### **Now is the time to move on**

Because businesses are so hesitant to provide feedback, do not waste too much time attempting to obtain information. Consider sending a short, courteous email asking for focused feedback if you didn&#8217;t receive an offer and would truly appreciate knowing how you may improve.

If you don&#8217;t hear back, don&#8217;t take it personally; instead, go on to the next interesting possibility after the job rejection. When you do get a positive reaction, take it to heart and apply it to your next job search.
