Sure, you may have put your career on hold and taken a job, but when that no longer fulfills you, you don&#8217;t abandon it. Yes, there is an immediate desire to give up and get on with things. The urge must be resisted.

The problem with leaving without having anything else lined up is that you can&#8217;t be sure there will be anything else one, two, or three. You could end up searching for the dream job for a longer period of time than you can afford.

You&#8217;ll be forced to choose yet another career that doesn&#8217;t satisfy you if this happens. And then you&#8217;re stuck and much less likely to try again â€“ after all, if you failed the first time, what makes you think you&#8217;ll be luckier the next time?.

So, before leaving your job, double-check that you have all of your fish in a row? What kind of fish am I referring to?

### **Is Your Resume Up to Date?**

You may as well get your resume in order because you&#8217;re already working somewhere else. After all, it&#8217;s your calling card, marketing plan, and history all wrapped into one once you&#8217;re back on the job market.

As a result, give it the attention it deserves. Fine-tune it. Put it aside for a week and then return to it to see if you&#8217;ve made any mistakes since the last time you read it.

Even better, enlist the help of others. Do you know someone with a keen eye for detail? Request that they take a look at it. Just make sure they&#8217;re not your coworkers, or your boss may find out before you&#8217;re ready.

You don&#8217;t know anyone? There are several programs available. Many academic writing programs, for example, even write resumes. Make sure you&#8217;re still prepared for the interview while you&#8217;re at it. After all, just having a foot in the door at your dream job isn&#8217;t enough. You&#8217;re looking for the whole package!

### **Improve the skills you&#8217;ll need to achieve your goals**

You can&#8217;t master every skill when doing another job. Some, on the other hand, are capable. If you want to be a teacher, for example, you should spend some time honing your skills before you quit your day job.

Sure, you could hit a point where you don&#8217;t get any better without actually diving in, but before then, take it easy. Improve your results.

Since you&#8217;re so attached to the thing once you&#8217;re doing it for a living, there&#8217;s rarely time to think and philosophically evaluate how you can change what you&#8217;re doing.

### **Did You Make a Good First Impression?**

The problem with leaving your job and throwing in the towel at your current workplace is that you may leave a lot of people behind. That is not something you can do. You never know when those people can come in handy. Your dream, for example, could not come true, and you&#8217;ll have to start again. Yes, it sounds unpleasant, but just because you don&#8217;t want it to happen doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t.

So make sure you tie up your loose ends, that your ship is in order, and that when you walk away, the people you&#8217;re working with have a smile on their faces. That way, if you ever need a guide, a new work, or something else, they&#8217;ll be there to support your efforts. After that, you&#8217;ll be grinning as well.

### **What Do You Want to Be?**

It appears to be a simple query. That isn&#8217;t the case. Most people spend their entire life trying to find out what they want to do with their lives. The secret, is not and try to figure out what you want to do with your life. That&#8217;s nearly impossible, owing in part to the fact that life is made up of many more than just one goal.

Instead, **concentrate on what you want to do now**. You don&#8217;t have to keep doing it indefinitely. You are not obligated to do that thing for the rest of your life. Simply stick with it until you&#8217;re satisfied. Another thing to keep in mind when leaving your work is not to confuse one target with another. Many people, for example, assume that having a [high-paying jobs](/high-paying-jobs-that-make-over-100000-per-year/) would make them happier.

That is not only false, but it is also a case of focusing on the wrong thing. *_Why worry about money when you can concentrate on making yourself happier?_ Isn&#8217;t that more successful than doing something that might or may not make a difference?

### **Final Thoughts**

Don&#8217;t take yourself or your work for granted. Yes, I realize it&#8217;s a pain. However, not everything in life can be sunshine. So make sure you&#8217;ve done your homework before leaving your job, and you&#8217;ll be sure to come out on top.

You&#8217;ll be glad you took the time to plan ahead. Regret is a deeply repulsive emotion.

Of course, this is true in both directions. Don&#8217;t over-slow yourself to the point that you don&#8217;t accomplish something. And the things we don&#8217;t do actually cause us much more remorse than the things we try but fail to do. But go ahead and take the dive. Just make sure you&#8217;ve done your homework and checked the water first.
