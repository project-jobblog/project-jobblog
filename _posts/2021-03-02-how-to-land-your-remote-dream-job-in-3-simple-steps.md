Before the COVID-19 pandemic, remote job opportunities were on the rise, and they are now more widely available.

Work-from-home opportunities are here to stay, and more job seekers will definitely seek them out in the future.

Although having options is advantageous, remote job positions will face stiff competition. Here are ways to make yourself stand out as a remote job candidate.

### **Calculate Your Remote Job Accomplishments**

It&#8217;s important to measure your job achievements while writing a resume. It&#8217;s the same thing when it comes to remote job experience! It&#8217;s not enough to simply mention that you&#8217;ve done remote work before. It&#8217;s also a good idea to try to measure what that entails.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Is your work efficiency higher now that you&#8217;re working from home?<br />Did you take on extra duties at work while working from home?
  </p>
</blockquote>

To illustrate that you&#8217;re a productive remote worker, use any specific examples you might think of. Businesses, in the end, want to be successful and prosperous, and they want to ensure that you can be a productive employee at home.

### **Take the initiative**

Are you a leader in the work-from-home experience at your former workplace, in addition to your quantifiable job accomplishments? If this is the case, make sure to include it in both your cover letter and resume.

Perhaps you hosted a remote job club or a company game night, or you were instrumental in planning and coordinating video meetings. This illustrates initiative and that, even though you&#8217;ll be operating remotely, you&#8217;ll be a productive employee.

Furthermore, as with any job application, you should study the organization you&#8217;re applying to, especially their remote job policies. This will help you make a case during the [interview process](/what-to-expect-in-a-final-job-interview/) about not just how you&#8217;ll blend into the company&#8217;s remote workforce, but also how you can contribute to it.

### **Familiarize yourself with remote activities**

Although getting [work-from-home](/category/work-from-home/) experience might not be sufficient in some situations, it is still a good idea to have some experience doing things remotely.

Virtual networking activities are becoming more common; you can look into the various forms of virtual networks that are available and participate in them. This will help you to gain experience participating in virtual events while also enhancing your networking abilities.

Participate in any online courses if you have a few skills you&#8217;d like to learn or develop. It&#8217;s also a good idea to brush up on your video interviewing skills, as video interviews will play an increasingly important role in work interviews in the future.

Both of these immersive experiences are merely a means of acclimating to working remotely and proving to prospective employers that you are adaptable and relaxed doing so.
