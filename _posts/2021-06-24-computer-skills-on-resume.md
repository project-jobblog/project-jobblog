Everyone nowadays has some form of computer skills that they can use when applying for a new job. So, should you continue to highlight your own expertise on your resume? Yes, Everyone has both hardware and software experience. You may or may not need to list the hardware you&#8217;re familiar with, depending on the type of job you&#8217;re going for.

However, the type of computer software you know could make or break your prospects of landing that job. Some software, such as Microsoft Office – and, in particular, Microsoft Word – can normally be left off a resume since an employer expects you already know how to use Microsoft Word. Instead, here are the most critical computer skills you must include on your resume.

### **Google Drive / Cloud Storage**

When it comes to documents and spreadsheets, many organizations today prefer to use Google Drive rather than Microsoft Office. There are a slew of other advantages to utilizing Google Drive, such as the ability to save your work in real time without having to do anything, or the option to share a document with many people who can all edit it. However, just putting &#8220;Google Drive&#8221; on your résumé isn&#8217;t enough. You want to go over everything you know about Google Drive in great detail. For example, as a main heading, you could write &#8220;Google Drive,&#8221; and then as subheadings, you can list the aspects with which you are most familiar.

  * Google Forms
  * Google Slides
  * Google Docs
  * Google Sheets

This nested approach can also be used for other software skills on your resume. If you wanted to mention Microsoft Office on your resume, for example, you could do something like this:

**Microsoft Office**

  * Word
  * Excel
  * Power Point

This list is not only more visually appealing and easier to skim, but it also informs the employer about your specific skills.

### **Various Operating Systems**

The operating system(s) with which you are most familiar should be listed on your CV. The reason for this is that some jobs demand knowledge of Macs, while others only utilize PCs. You may find it challenging to manage a Mac if you have more expertise with a PC, for example. If the company believes you are the best candidate for the job, they will invest additional time in training you. As a result, it&#8217;s critical to be honest about the operating system you&#8217;re most comfortable with.

### **The Internet and Social Media**

Social media is unquestionably among the &#8220;Most Important Computer Skills to List on a Resume.&#8221; Businesses all over the world use social media, and while they may vary in which channels they use, they have come to realize that when it comes to running a business, social media is important. It&#8217;s the quickest method to get the word out about new products and services, as well as give a sounding board for existing consumers and clients &#8211; and perhaps even attract new ones.

So, how can you convince a potential employer that you have what it takes to provide their business with the social media platform it deserves? You can talk about the accomplishments that social media has brought you in addition to listing the specific platforms with which you have the most expertise (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and so on).

Did you frequently track the company&#8217;s post engagements on Twitter at your previous company? Did you look through Google Analytics to see what worked and what didn&#8217;t in the company&#8217;s social media advertising campaigns? Were you able to assess the scope of the company&#8217;s operations and how to best expand it? All of these are skills you can – and should – mention in your resume&#8217;s computer skills section.

### **How to List Computer Skills on a Resume**

When it comes to listing your computer skills on your resume, it&#8217;s crucial to remember that you shouldn&#8217;t place them in their own section. Instead, show how your computer skills have helped you throughout your career by incorporating them into your resume. In an ideal world, these skills would be concentrated in three areas:

  * Your professional summary or objective statement
  * Your main skills section
  * Your experience

Of course, don&#8217;t try to cram your experience into places where it doesn&#8217;t belong. Instead, look for spots where you could naturally insert a talent, and you&#8217;ll end up with a more well-rounded résumé.
