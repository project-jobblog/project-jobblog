Equipped with a degree and a suite of abilities and skills, you are unexpectedly pushed from an atmosphere of comfort and familiarity (namely, school) and headfirst into a vast, alien networking environment, lunching with recruiters and [applying for jobs](/where-to-apply-to-make-a-great-career/). Fortune favors the willing, and as overwhelming as job searching can sound, if you put in a bit of effort, it&#8217;s a method you can master.

### **_Professional Headshot_**

In today&#8217;s hyper-connected business world, Professional networking sites such as LinkedIn have become &#8220;de rigueur&#8221; and getting an impressive headshot instead of a selfie can cement a strong first impression in the minds of recruiters and potential employees.

Keep these useful tips in mind for your first professional photoshoot: use a plain backdrop and dress in accordance with the specifications of your industry. Enable your personality to shine through, but don&#8217;t be too out of the box or overwhelmingly quirky.

### **_References_**

You will want to come in as qualified and competent as possible during the job interview process, and if the company is interested in recruiting you, they will possibly contact your references to hear what they have to say about you. It makes a lot of difference whether there is a good word for a professor or manager to chip in. It is not only empowering to have someone trustworthy and well-established vouch for your abilities and work ethic, but can also help persuade future employers that as an employee you are a worthwhile investment.

### **_Curriculum Vitae / Resume_**

You need to build one right away if you find yourself without a solid CV. A curriculum vitae is a full, unabridged record of your professional and educational credentials for the uninitiated: accomplishments and activities carried out during high school and university, skill sets gained during internships and more information such as awards, publications and memberships in society.

While the words &#8220;Resume&#8221; and &#8220;Curriculum Vitae&#8221; are sometimes used interchangeably, bear in mind that a curriculum vitae is a short version of your resume and includes only vital data and should not be longer than one page. By comparison, a CV is relatively long and can reach three pages.<

### **_Professional Communication Skills_**

You&#8217;ll probably spend the first few months crafting and sending out hundreds of resumes, cover letters and follow-up emails after graduation. There are some business communication guidelines that you must follow, such as keeping a structured tone, forgoing abbreviations and emojis, writing full sentences and using proper punctuation, unlike dropping a text message or adding an update on social media.

For HR professionals and managers, typos and inconsistent formatting like text fonts of different sizes and designs are big turn-offs. What&#8217;s more, it makes you look sloppy, uncaring and lazy to send out emails filled with mistakes, and is a sure-shot way not to get recruited. To make sure they&#8217;re pitch-perfect, take your time crafting emails and cover letters.

### **_A Winning Mindset_**

There&#8217;s no easy way to put it down: you&#8217;re going to face rejection. Despite your best efforts to elicit a response only to contact you six months later, businesses, recruiters and employers can go completely silent on you only to tell you that the role you had given up on has been filled. The phase of job searching can be frustrating and emotionally taxing, but you should never give up.

As a fresh graduates, you have access to possibilities and opportunities not accessible to other job seekers, so make good use of them. Chat with campus career fair members, attend university networking events, sign up for career clinics and seek the lecturers&#8217; technical (and life) advice. You have nothing to lose and everything to win, go ahead and do whatever you need to do to clinch the work you&#8217;ve been eyeing.
