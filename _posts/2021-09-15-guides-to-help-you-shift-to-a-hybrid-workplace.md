Guides To Help You Shift to a Hybrid Workplace: Many non-essential personnel has had to shift to working remotely since the outbreak began. New obstacles arose as a result of the transition, including navigating virtual meetings and re-creating an effective workstation from home. As the pandemic progresses, some businesses have decided to return to the office 100 percent of the time, while others have adopted a fully remote policy and are considering a hybrid work style.

### **What is the definition of a hybrid work model?**

Employees on a hybrid work plan spend part of their time at the office and the rest of their time working remotely. The number of remote workdays and logistics differ greatly from one company to the next. It not only allows employees to manage their time more effectively, but it also allows businesses to expand their hiring markets and talent pools rather than limiting themselves to a few areas.

This work approach is in line with the preferences of many employees. According to a global [survey](https://www.steelcase.com/research/articles/topics/work-better/first-wave-workplace-change/), Up to 90%,) of the 32,000 workers polled expressed a desire to return to work in some form. In the post-COVID age, 46% of American workers plan to [work from home](/category/work-from-home/) two to five days each week.

As more companies investigate or even adopt a hybrid work strategy, they are being deliberate in how they modify their work processes. For one thing, individuals in a hybrid workplace must consider how their communication skills benefit the team, whether they are working remotely or in the office.

### **Tips for communicating in a hybrid workplace**

A hybrid approach, as opposed to a fully remote business where everyone works from home, means that you may be working in the office while other crucial teammates work remotely (or vice versa). Here are a few pointers for maintaining excellent workplace communication.



**Determine the most effective means of communication**

When you choose the optimal communication channel for a task, it produces greater results, especially when you&#8217;re working away from the office.

For example, an instant messaging tool like **Slack** or **Trello** is preferable for a fast check-in with a teammate on the status of a design you need in thirty minutes. When sending a step-by-step set of instructions as an email, it can be easier to follow.

And, while we&#8217;re on the subject of the email, remote workers will benefit from [improving their skills](/tips-on-how-to-improve-your-soft-skills-at-work/) in this crucial method of communication, as they&#8217;ll be writing more frequently than having in-person conversations. Face-to-face communication at the office is made easier by visual and audial signals such as facial expressions, body gestures, and tone; writing requires more precision without this visual input.

Working remotely via email or a messaging system can muddle the reception of your message.

**Use meeting assets and tools to build equity**

When not everyone is in the same room, make sure meeting materials are in a format that can be used in both work and personal contexts. For example, if you&#8217;ve printed out a PowerPoint presentation for in-person guests, make a digital deck available to virtual attendees so they can follow along.

This applies to in-person tools as well, such as a whiteboard during a meeting. Assist the team member who is utilizing a whiteboard in correctly positioning their camera so that faraway colleagues can see the entire board.

As a hybrid working model also may allow for flexible schedules or for team members to work across time zones, not every stakeholder might be available during the meeting. Plan ahead by sharing an agenda ahead of a meeting and habitually sending meeting recaps and follow-ups and recordings so everyone is aligned.

**Determine the most important face-to-face encounters**

When attendees can collaborate live and in person, some meetings are most effective. This could arise, for example, while discussing a new product in-depth or organizing team-building exercises.

Some meetings, on the other hand, are just as effective when held remotely. Virtual meetings are great for transmitting short bursts of information or gatherings with a small number of attendees. One-on-one meetings with managers, project standups, and general corporate announcements are just a few examples.

Certain updates don&#8217;t even need to be presented in a meeting and can be shared by email or instant message instead.

**Improve your social skills**

Knowing how to develop genuine connections in the office is an important element of building a harmonious relationship with your coworkers. Small talk skills can help you generate mutual trust and build relationships with your hybrid team members. As you improve your social skills, remember to set limits throughout your in-person workdays.

While working remotely or in person, there are numerous ways to form connections. On remote days, offer a team virtual happy hour or invite a coworker to lunch while you&#8217;re in the office.

You&#8217;ll learn which approaches are most beneficial for your day-to-day work and team as you navigate the new hybrid workplace. No matter where you work, use the recommendations above and experiment with different strategies to improve good communication.
