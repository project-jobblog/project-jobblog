The phase of job searching can be busy. Candidates spend time crafting and submitting resumes and cover letters, contacting networks, and waiting for replies to be heard. But it&#8217;s also a good idea to take a step back regularly. From the ground up, here&#8217;s how to improve your [job search](https://www.jobssearches.org/) strategy.

### **_Become an expert at networking_**

When you&#8217;re an [introvert](https://www.webmd.com/balance/introvert-personality-overview) or hate networking, it can be hard to collect the energy from the network. However, some of the most successful networkers are generally better at listening than talking. They take the time to build relationships with individuals, seek input, and ask for advice, instead of asking for a job. As is the case for other stuff, over time, successful networking occurs and requires effort.

To develop and communicate with your professional network, take small steps every day, and you may just find your way to your [dream job](/tips-you-need-to-find-your-dream-job-and-get-hired-faster/).

### **_Be strategic when reaching out_**

It is a good idea to first choose a company, then search for a job. That being said, there are undoubtedly correct and incorrect ways of doing it. Find out what the recruiting process is at the organization with which you want to work, and then search for an opening in a decision-making position to make direct contact with someone.

It will save you time and energy to find the right people in the business to follow up with, and hopefully, get you a response sooner than later.

### **_Have a Job Search Strategy_**

Come up with a schedule for job search and set aside daily time to spend on job searches.

Have a structured space to use during your job search in your house, and build a system to look at job boards and keep track of all your apps. Know which jobs, along with the job title and company name, you have applied for and label on a calendar when you need to follow up.

### **_Quality Over Quantity_**

Although it might seem as if when you send out more applications, the chances of getting a job increase, that may not be the case. Job seekers are best served by taking the time to tailor each resume and customize the particular job with each cover letter. This not only explains why (and how) you&#8217;re the right candidate for the job to the hiring manager, but it can also help you make it past applicant monitoring systems that search for unique resume keywords.

Read the job description carefully and study the company before applying. A high-quality, well-thought-out application creates a good impression.

### **_Connecting the Dots_**

There are occasions when you might be able to apply for several positions in the same company, but make sure that each role does not use the same exact application. Recruiters may be able to hear how you are fit for both a marketing coordinator role and a developer role, but to link the dots, it is necessary to use your cover letter.

Remember that your application can be received by the same person each time, so you&#8217;ll want each resume and cover letter to clarify the specific skills for that position in a unique way.

### **_Be prepared and well informed_**

Oh, congratulations! The recruiter was impressed with your application, and now you&#8217;ve been invited to a job interview. You need to be strong and express your importance to the organization, your ability to do the job, and your business knowledge. Be prepared with plenty of [questions to ask during the interview](/what-to-expect-in-a-final-job-interview/), so there is nothing left for you to say.
