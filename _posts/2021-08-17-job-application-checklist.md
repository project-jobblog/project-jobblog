There are a lot of details to remember when applying for a job, but we&#8217;re here to make it easier for you! Use this fast and simple job application checklist to make sure you&#8217;re always putting your best foot forward.

## **Checklist for your Job Applications**

  * Concentrate the job search on the businesses and positions that concern you the most. You&#8217;re much less likely to succeed if you cast a large net and apply for anything and all.
  * Make your cover letter and resume exclusive to you. Taking the time to explain why you are the [perfect fit for this position](/how-to-figure-out-if-you-are-right-for-the-job/) with specific examples will improve the chances of getting an answer from prospective employers.
  * Make certain that your social media profiles are polished and professional. The vast majority of employers will conduct an online search for potential employees. Alternatively, you could make two separate versions, one personal and the other private.
  * Spend some time on your LinkedIn profile&#8217;s refinement. Make sure your profile is accurate and up to date (e.g., a current photo, a well-written summary, etc.). Consider writing a blog post to show your knowledge and experience in your field.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

  * Have a link to your personal website in your signature. This isn&#8217;t required in every field, but in some (e.g., marketing, it&#8217;s a great way to show off your work samples to prospective employers.
  * If you come across a job posting that screams your name, apply as soon as possible. It&#8217;s not too late to apply if you&#8217;re seeing it for the first time since it&#8217;s been up for a week or two.
  * Always pay attention to the instructions. To ensure that your application passes through the ATS and is approved by the hiring manager, try to follow the directions of the job posting exactly as they appear.
  * Keep track of your submissions. This way, you will confirm that the hiring manager received your resume, respond to any questions they may have, and get on their radar.

  * Make the most of your relations! Reaching out to your professional network, whether virtually or in person, can be a great way to find positions that aren&#8217;t advertised on job boards or with companies you&#8217;ve never considered.
  * Ensure that the application is tailored for the applicant tracking system (ATS). In your submission, use keywords from the job posting and stop using difficult-to-read resume fonts.
  * Using a reliable email provider to get a professional email address that includes a variation of your name (i.e., gmail).
  * Unless the job posting clearly states otherwise, please send a cover letter with your application. It&#8217;s another opportunity for you to market yourself and add some personality to your application.
  * Before you press &#8220;send,&#8221; make sure you proofread your submission. If you&#8217;re unsure, have someone you trust look over your materials first.
  * Stay away from job-search burnout. Take a break to refresh and recharge if you&#8217;re applying for jobs all day every day or aren&#8217;t as interested in your work quest as you were at the outset.
