With COVID-19, we&#8217;re not out of the woods yet. Cases are at an all-time high over much of the United States, keeping people in a continual state of fear.

If you were intending to changing career this year, your plans were most likely put on hold in the spring when unemployment was at its highest. While unemployment has been declining since May, millions of people who did not expect to be unemployed have returned to the job market.

So you&#8217;re wondering if it&#8217;s even a good idea to pursue a job change right now. It might very well be. Let&#8217;s look at the Advantages and Disadvantages of changing career during the pandemic:

## **Disadvantages of Changing Career During the Pandemic**

### **Job burnout or pandemic burnout**

You are not alone in feeling stressed at work because of the status of the globe. More than half of workers suffered burnout when working remotely during the epidemic.

While you may believe your burnout is caused by the nature of your job, it&#8217;s possible that other worries are interfering with your work. This becomes a problem if you wish to change careers because you are unhappy in your current one. Even if you start a new job route, you&#8217;ll most certainly encounter burnout.

Don&#8217;t make a career change solely because you&#8217;re burned out. Check to see if any other things are influencing your decision. Also, don&#8217;t forget to lean on your support system.

### **Uncertainty in the job market**

With millions of people [out of work in the United States](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) and many businesses apprehensive about their futures, there is a greater demand for jobs than there are available. Despite the fact that unemployment has decreased since the outbreak, many companies are still hiring.

While you may no longer enjoy your current employment, it may be in your best interests to stick it out until the end of the pandemic. If your company hasn&#8217;t contemplated furloughs or layoffs, your existing job security can give you peace of mind. You may not want to take paying your payments for the next several months for granted.

### **Onboarding is more difficult**

In a temporary remote working environment, starting a new job can be difficult. You&#8217;d have to meet your new employees virtually and become acquainted with their temporary business culture. Unless the organization intends to remain virtual once the epidemic is gone, you&#8217;ll have to start anew when the organization returns to a physical location.

You can&#8217;t be confident that the corporate culture that piques your interest in the interview will be the same until you&#8217;re a year or two into the role, especially with so much change in the last year. If you decide to hunt for a new job or you [need a new job](/signs-that-you-need-a-new-job/), inquire about the company&#8217;s past and present culture to help you make an informed selection.

### **It&#8217;s time to reevaluate your priorities**

One of the most compelling reasons to make a career change now is because you&#8217;ve likely had plenty of time to consider it this year. The epidemic provided a unique opportunity for introspection while sheltering at home and [working remotely](/category/work-from-home/).

What have you recognized is vital to you now that you&#8217;ve experienced a drastically different work environment in 2020?

Consider your employment responsibilities, benefits, flexibility, and prospects for advancement, among other things. Make a list of what you like and don&#8217;t like. If you&#8217;re finding more flaws in your employment than you used to, it&#8217;s time to make a change.

You have plenty of time to think about your feelings about your current employment, as well as what path might be more aligned with your principles. If you decide to change careers, this can help you narrow down your job search.

### **Geography is no longer a restriction**

Companies are employing virtually for the foreseeable future as a result of businesses relocating to remote areas. Because you&#8217;re in a different city, the virtual work environment allows you to apply for jobs you couldn&#8217;t apply for before.

If you&#8217;re making a job change that requires you to work in a different region of the world, now is the time to get your foot in the door. On job boards, search for jobs that are &#8220;remote&#8221; to see all of your new alternatives.



### **People are eager to assist you in making connections**

People who have held their employment this year are frequently commenting on social media that they wish to aid their friends and family members who are affected by the pandemic. This readiness to help one another makes it a fantastic opportunity to meet people from all professions.

Some people are offering to help contacts connect with recruiters and hiring managers, examine resumes, provide letters of recommendation, and give [interview tips](/online-job-interview-tips-in-the-wake-of-coronavirus/).

Now is a fantastic time to reach out to people in your network (as well as those who have put out an open call) to make connections that will help you progress in your profession.
