How to Become More Assertive at Work? How come some people appear to receive exactly what they want while others do not? The answer is straightforward: assertiveness.

Assertiveness is a nuanced art that some people appear to instinctively perfect. The rest of us muddle through, much of the time acting in passive-aggressive ways. Things go our way occasionally, but this is mostly down to luck.

The good news is that assertiveness skills can be taught and improved.

### **What Does it Mean to be Assertive?**

Being self-assured and confident without being confrontational is the attribute of assertiveness.

Assertiveness also seeks to respect other people&#8217;s views, feelings, and beliefs.

It is, however, frequently misconstrued and mixed up with other communication reactions such as hostility, passiveness, and passive aggression.
