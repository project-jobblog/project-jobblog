As several states react to the COVID-19 crisis by closing any non-essential enterprises, the national unemployment rate is growing, resulting in abrupt lay-offs of millions of employees.

We want to help by providing some guidance on how to find a new job in the current environment if you find yourself in this position. This will mean, for others, seeking a new position similar to your current career path, but adjusting your work search to a more competitive world and a remote recruitment process.

It would mean moving your expertise to a different form of job for others, at least temporarily, before more jobs in industries that are struggling open up again.

### Take Stock of Your Transferable Skills

If you have worked for a long time , or maybe even your entire career in the same industry, you might not have thought a lot about other kinds of employment in which you could potentially succeed.

You probably have abilities that are so much a part of how you work that you don&#8217;t even think of them as abilities from day to day. Organization or time management, for example.

Right now, you&#8217;re going to try to concentrate entirely on skills that you can move from the industry you&#8217;ve been working into a new job. It can be useful in the world of work to think of job skills as falling into two categories: hard skills and [soft skills](/category/soft-skills/).

Hard abilities, or technical skills, are items that are taught, such as knowledge of certain technologies, learning how to code, understanding procedures for food handling, or running equipment. These talents are quantifiable, and you typically learn stuff in a classroom or at work.

Soft skills are personal qualities that are more innate, typically related to working well with others. Communication, cooperation, and dispute resolution are some examples.

With a piece of paper, sit down and draw two columns. Put on one hand your hard skills and on the other, your soft skills. This will provide you a more detailed description of what your work abilities are. By default, many individuals are humble. Write down any talent that you possess. If an ability is especially powerful, make note of it.

You can, however, inventory ALL of your abilities or skills, including those that may seem quite basic.

For example, you have some teamwork abilities if you&#8217;ve worked with others. Simple competency is sufficient for many jobs. Later, you can evaluate how your abilities complement particular occupations. For now, in mentioning all the hard and soft skills you can think of, be generous.

First, let&#8217;s take a look at where the latest openings are and which businesses are ramping up recruiting right now, to find out where and how to apply your skills.

### Find out which industries are booming

In the last few months, consumer purchasing preferences have changed dramatically, as essential foods and products have flown off the shelves and non-essentials are not moving just as quickly.

In addition, state-wide compulsory &#8220;shelter in place&#8221; policies have meant that individuals sit at home and order in.

This has contributed to many thousands of job vacancies in the food and delivery service sectors, predictably.

These are significant work, but can entail some risk. Although several businesses have instituted contactless deliveries to reduce the risk of exposure to virus, some work opportunities require public interaction.

In these positions and research businesses, it is necessary to take the proper measures to understand how they protect their workers.

Retail and distribution companies that have confirmed that they are recruiting people with skills usually include:

  * Accounting 
  * Advertising 
  * Enginering 
  * HealthCare 
  * Human Resources 
  * Information Technology 

Next, in online learning, there are also new resources. From preschool to graduate school to continuing professional education, all forms of schools and learning institutions have switched to online learning. Kids need assistance with remote learning and, although trapped at home, many adults are searching for learning opportunities.

The market for e-learning services has also risen as a consequence of these innovations.

More opportunities than ever to teach and mentor online are open. Parents are searching for tutors to support them with the online learning of their children in school subjects and extracurriculars, if you have experience with them.

Study tutoring and homework-help companies to see if they have opportunities. Start by searching on our website for tutor vacancies. You may also want to reach out to see if their lessons have been transferred online by some after-school services and require additional assistance.

Similarly, you might be able to provide online courses for adults if you are an expert in a specific field. Think of any talents you have that can be remotely taught, such as yoga, graphic design, music, languages, writing, and programming. Again, at existing companies, you can find a new job or start your own freelance business.

### Starting your own business

In the middle of pandemic?! It sounds nuts, but it&#8217;s pretty pragmatic really.

There&#8217;s a fair chance you&#8217;ve got some sort of side hustle already. Do you fix machines that are small? Got an online shop? For your friends and family, create easy websites? Do landscaping work?

Now you have time to turn something better into the passive endeavor or hobby.

Starting a company does not have to mean getting space for a brick and mortar and taking out a business loan.

It can be as easy as starting a profile and bidding for jobs on a freelance website like **_Upwork_**. Or start cultivating your interest in your Etsy store, blog, podcast, Youtube channel or other platforms already.

    It&#8217;s a rare opportunity to satisfy a demand right now.

We have already spoken about e-learning and childcare, but put the imagination to use in thinking about how to solve issues that are actually emerging from demand.

Have you got an idea for a platform that operates remotely? A delivery service? During this critical time, invest in yourself and come out on the other side of a company owner who has turned the entire situation around.

### Tap Your Network

The time to make use of that network is now!

Hopefully, over the years, you have spent some time making contacts, even if in a casual manner. Now&#8217;s the time for networking to become a bit more strategic.

In reality, it can be an excellent opportunity to polish up some career development instruments that might be a little rusty to have some more time on your hands. Stuff like your resume, online profile, technical headshots, certifications and skills and the like.

Think of your closest and dearest first-relatives, friends, and close colleagues when it comes to networking, who might actually work in a stable field you know you have the skills to apply for.

The pandemic offers the new job-seeker the benefit of global solidarity, distressing as it is. Everyone knows and acknowledges that right now things are rough and many individuals are searching for ways to help.

There&#8217;s never been a better time to access your network than now, when many people, especially someone they know and care about, will be looking to give a helping hand.

It&#8217;s time to cast a wider net if you&#8217;ve thought about your skill set and can&#8217;t make a connection with your personal network.

On social media, or wherever you digitally congregate with others, reach out to your online network or those in your professional groups. Let them know you&#8217;re looking for a job and what abilities you&#8217;ve got. Just by putting yourself out there, you may be shocked at what kind of possibilities open up.

    It&#8217;s just a Plot Twist, Your Life Is Not Over
  </p>
</blockquote>

It&#8217;s important to note that your work is not your life, no matter how destabilizing things might be right now, and reinventing yourself is possible.

It may not be easy or quick, but you can and will be once again employed and stabilized.

The changes that will result from COVID-19 can be beneficial in several positives. It has the ability to revolutionize how we think about our work as a country and carry it out. It can contribute to an improvement in working hours and healthcare coverage flexibility.

And for you personally, for a career choice you might not have been satisfied with, it can be used as a reset button. If you have felt stuck before, or if you have not been living up to your potential, now is the time to start again.

The trick is to not give in to despair and be imaginative in solving your dilemma. If you don&#8217;t fit with one solution to seeking a new career after you&#8217;ve been laid off, plan a fresh angle and try again.

You have more expertise and a wider network than you think you have. Don&#8217;t sell yourself short. Right now, people are banding together to support each other and everything is going to be okay.
