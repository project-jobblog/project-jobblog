Have you started thinking about graduation yet? Have you set your sights on landing your first job—and earning a nice salary? What you majored in to earn your bachelor&#8217;s degree has a huge impact on how much money you&#8217;ll make. So, what are the best college majors for earning the most money right out of the gate?

We took the average starting salaries of many prominent college majors from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) [Winter 2021 Salary Survey Report](https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/starting-salary-projections-positive-for-the-class-of-2021/) and narrowed it down to the top that lead to well-paying jobs. The wages were gathered after NACE surveyed its members from September to November 2020. They do not include overtime, bonuses, or other benefits.

STEM majors (science, technology, engineering, and math) came out on top, as anticipated. However, keep in mind that salaries vary depending on your level of experience, specialization, and location in the world. A civil engineer salary in California, is 11% higher than the national median; a computer scientist salary in Missouri, is 1% higher than the national median; and an elementary school teacher salary in Arkansas, is 11% lower.
