The job search is not an easy task. In fact, according to a [research](https://resources.careerbuilder.com/guides/candidate-experience-guide?utm_source=careerbuilder&utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_campaign=candidateexperience2017_b2b), 73 percent of job seekers consider it to be one of the most stressful events of their lives. The interviewing procedure is, without a question, the most stressful aspect of the entire job search.

Meeting recruiters and realizing your future job is in the balance of a 30-minute talk is a nerve-wracking experience. Interviewers may doubt you as a candidate because of simple phrases, statements, or even questions. Don&#8217;t let a misunderstanding with your interviewers keep you from getting a wonderful job.

If you&#8217;re looking for work, here are some things you should avoid saying to interviewers.

### **I adore your dress!**

When your flattery is focused on what they&#8217;re wearing or what they own, you&#8217;re not going to win over your interviewers. It could be construed as a fake. If you want to give your interviewers a compliment, choose something connected to the company&#8217;s work that you appreciate and can easily discuss.

### **I&#8217;ll do everything you want**

You may be enthusiastic about finding work, but desperation will not help you. Instead, tell your interviewers why you&#8217;re the [best candidate for the position](/dos-and-donts-when-you-are-an-overqualified-job-seeker/) you&#8217;re applying for. This could be due to your abilities, experience, or even the fact that your personalities are compatible.

### **I&#8217;m not sure**

In a job interview, this response is a common blunder. Spend a minute assembling your thoughts if you truly don&#8217;t know the answer to an interview question about yourself or your background. Let your interviewers know you&#8217;ll get back to them by the end of the day if nothing comes to mind. Remember that having the perfect answer isn&#8217;t always the goal when it comes to situational **interview questions**. Frequently, these questions ask you to describe your mental process and personality.

### **Please accept my apologies, I&#8217;m quite nervous**

Nerves are totally typical when it comes to job interviews. However, revealing it with your interviewers isn&#8217;t a good idea. Instead, concentrate on being self-assured and pushing through your fears. No one wants to hire someone who lacks self-assurance.

### **Perfectionism is my greatest weakness**

When it comes to discussing your strengths and weakness, stay away from the typical responses. Interviewers will not believe this response because it is most likely false. This response also provides no information about your working style or personality. Choose a weakness that is actually a strength or something you&#8217;re actively working on improving and have solid evidence to present with interviewers.

### **I don&#8217;t have any questions for you**

You may think this makes you appear confident and prepared, but it actually makes you appear uninterested in the work or organization. Interviews are conversations, and interviewers expect candidates to participate in them. Prepare a few questions about the company or role to ask at the end of the job interview to help you learn more.

### **Could you tell me the title of this role again**

Every interview requires that you arrive properly prepared. Any inquiries that demonstrate you haven&#8217;t done your homework on the firm, the job description, or the industry suggest that you&#8217;re unprepared and possibly disinterested in the position. Prepare for each job interview by conducting research as if it were a final exam.

### **How fast do people in this position usually advance?**

Your desire to advance your career is admirable. Hiring managers, on the other hand, are looking for long-term personnel. When you start talking about progression before you even have the job, it&#8217;s usually a hint you don&#8217;t want to stay. Find a way to bring up how advancement normally works within the organization if the issue of your future ambitions arises.
